TL;DR:
I’m speaking to three groups of middle schoolers on Career Day about what marketing actually is. I want it to be fun, interactive, and relevant to their real lives (social media, ads, influence, choices, etc.). Looking for your expert ideas: What would you teach kids about marketing? What concepts matter most? What examples or hands-on activities would keep them engaged?
Before I dive in, yes, I used ChatGPT to help structure this post. But the ask is very real, and every idea here is mine. I brain-dumped four pages in a Google Doc of what I want to cover, what I want the students to learn, and the interactive elements I want to build. I’m just using AI to help present it clearly so I can get solid feedback from people who actually work in marketing, you.
I’ve been invited to speak at a local middle school for their Career Day, and I’ll be presenting to three groups of up to 28 students, each for about 25 minutes. I’ll be covering what I do as a marketing professional/freelancer/consultant, and I’m trying to craft something that’s both engaging and actually useful for kids this age.
Being middle schoolers, I want to keep things visual, interactive, and fun, but grounded in real marketing fundamentals. I’d love to hear from this community what you believe is vital to present to middle schoolers and might be relevant to them today. Things like how marketing affects their ideas and decisions, what they buy and use, and even how they see topics like politics, identity, and trends.
# What I’m thinking so far:
# 1. Start with the question “What is marketing?”
I expect basic answers like: Ads, Commercials, Trying to sell stuff, Logos, Social media influencers, or Coupons.
# 2. Give a simple overview of marketing types.
Thinking of covering:
* Traditional marketing, Digital marketing, Product marketing, Brand marketing, Content marketing, PR
Anything missing or better for this age group?
# 3. Hammer home the most underrated part of marketing: research.
My main lesson:
Your assumptions are usually wrong without user research.
I’m planning to do a quick live “user research test” with show-of-hands questions to reveal unexpected truths. Examples I’m considering:
* “Pick your favorite snack from these four options.”
* “Which of these logos looks the most trustworthy?”
* “Which thumbnail would you click?”
* A fast ‘NPS-style’ question—e.g., ‘On a scale of 0–10, how likely are you to recommend this school to a friend?’ or ‘How likely are you to recommend \[a fun, school-appropriate teacher\]?’
* Then showing how marketers categorize detractors/passives /promoters and why it matters.
If anyone has run an exercise like this with students (or adults!), what questions worked best?
# 4. Show a &lt;1 min clip from a marketing thought leader.
Preferably something reinforcing:
“Marketing isn’t just colors and shapes, it’s critical thinking.”

Hey everyone,
Ever tried writing a business case study that actually convinces decision-makers?
You spend hours gathering data, interviewing stakeholders, and trying to structure everything logically. You write what you think is a compelling narrative... but it comes out either too academic or too salesy. Investors skim it, clients ignore it, and you're left wondering why your hard work isn't getting results.
I've been there too many times. The gap between what we think makes a good case study and what actually persuades business audiences is massive. Most advice out there is either super basic (""tell a good story"") or so complicated you need an MBA to implement it.
So I did what any rational business professional would do: analyzed hundreds of successful case studies, studied what actually drives decision-making, and built a comprehensive prompt that turns ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Grok into a professional business analyst and case study writer.
This isn't ""write me a case study about X"" that gives you generic, forgettable content. This is a complete framework covering everything from data-driven storytelling to measurable outcomes.

Not just ""tell a story."" The prompt teaches AI to:
- Use the HERO framework (Hook-Engage-Resolve-Outcome)
- Balance technical depth with accessibility

- Maintain professional but engaging tone throughout
**4. Multiple Business Scenarios Covered**
Whether you're doing:

Alright y’all, I’ve been seeing a million posts on Reddit talking about Andromeda, how Meta has destroyed ad campaigns, and people speaking of their budgets getting royally f&amp;%ked.
After spending the past few weeks rebuilding \~$2M/mo in ad account spend, and since Andromeda has been hitting my campaigns at different times (seems to have been slowly released and hit more/less aggressively by industry and spend amount) – I had to look at this in first principles. So I dove way too deep into Meta’s engineering blog and then spoke with a few, far more impressive Meta ads peeps I’m friendly with. Then I even chatted with someone high up at Meta and got the inside scoop.
Here’s my honest take on what’s going on with Facebook Ads right now.
More importantly, I think it’s important to look forward on the ‘who, what, and why’ before we all panic.
\#1 | **You’re not crazy and Zuck doesn’t really care about ads**
You didn’t see a drop off because of your pixel. It wasn’t iOS. It wasn’t your ad creatives being improperly sized or your CTA or anything else.
It was **Meta quietly changing their algorithm without explicitly telling anyone.** I don’t particularly respect this, as Zuck has no problem going on podcasts to discuss their Glasses which have like 10k customers. But for the ad engine that accounts for 20-30% of global ad spend, they drop a quiet blog. Shame Zuck, shame.
I’ve long since suspected Zuck really doesn’t give a shit about ads. I genuinely believe Zuck makes it nearly impossible to spend your money unless you're an extremely large account (and thus has an account executive). But then I'll see people who are already spending many millions on Meta and ***still*** don't have any kind of AE. It seems like the barrier to have a dedicated Meta AE is like tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in spend. Shockingly, I don't understand why!
For example, I've had multiple clients who are ready and willing to spend tens of thousands of dollars a month, but for whatever reason, it's impossible to get their account restricted. It's almost always for the most unnecessary and useless account restrictions. I am ready and willing to spend money on your platform, and yet the entire customer support staff is like 3 women in the Phillippines.
**#2 | Zuck understands there are 4 stakeholders in the Meta advertising customer journey:**
Creative/Creators &gt; Marketer &gt; CTA/Landing Page &gt; Customer
Zuck’s job is in matching core customer characteristics (behavior, readiness to buy, income, misc dopamine factors). This is 10x harder than Google, which can essentially force a bottom of funnel sale. Zuck needs to ensure the ad is good enough to convince you to leave your (already hyper addictive) IG page.
That’s a tough problem to crack!
Also, Zuck has realized a lot of the marketing spend is based around people who are not very impressive - clearly not as impressive as his elite team of ML and AI researc",https://reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1o92ywe/my_thoughts_on_metas_andromeda_and_how_to_succeed/,0,2,0,0,subreddit:marketing|1|2|3|4|5,,,"{""subreddit"": ""marketing""}",3000,2,0.0,40,

I hypothesize there are couple of reasons for this:
1. Google/ChatGPT likely has a way to flag AI content and doesn’t want to train their AI with another AI model.
2. AI generated content is (usually) unoriginal which leads to it ranking the original source above the AI generated regurgitation.

The description? Building the infrastructure for paid marketing campaigns, integrations with major ad platforms, and real-time attribution pipelines. Translation: **ads inside ChatGPT are no longer “if”, they’re “when.”**
Why this is big:
* ChatGPT is becoming more and more intent-driven. That's Google’s territory. If ads roll out here, it could be the first real threat to search ad dominance in 20 years. And to be honest, as a Google Ads PPC expert, that would be more than welcome after years of increasing CPCs/CPAs and worsening lead quality (not only on Google, but still).
* The formats are still a mystery. Native “thought leadership” style (like LinkedIn)? Or classic interruptive formats? Both would most likely change how we run campaigns.
* Trust is the elephant in the room. How do you keep users confident if generative answers start blending with sponsored content? This is a big unknown ultimately shaping everything.
OpenAI's head of ChatGPT has already said before that they won’t rule out ads, but they need to be “thoughtful and tasteful.”

It’s obvious that there’s an influx of Reddit users passively promoting their own products or services on posts and comments and honestly it’s embarrassing!
I suspect that this is because there’s this narrative that generative search engines and LLMs most frequently cite UGC from the likes of Reddit and Quora.
Let me be clear, the reason these platforms are cited most frequently is simply due to the sheer quantity of related content on these platforms. AI goes NOT prioritise the content on these platforms. If part of your marketing strategy includes writing promotional content thinly veiled behind some shitpost, please for the love of god, cease and desist.
We need to return to generating meaningful content which is aligned with a users behaviour at each stage of the buyer journey, not trying to “hack” some LLMs algorithm.

Just started a new position at a company doing event marketing. Primarily I am to create email invitations for events and do follow up nurture campaigns.
I work across different industries based out of the US, Europe, India, and Australia.
The process is supposed to do the following
1) I get a campaign brief of the event.
2) I create the pre-event copy for invitations - the field marketer reviews the copy and asks for edits/tweaks. I then make them and the process is approved and set up to do sending.
3) I create the post-event copy showcasing the event, providing related content, asking if they would like a demo, and putting the rest into a post event nurture depending on what content they interacted with. - the field marketer reviews and asks for edits/tweaks. I then make them and the process is approved and set up to do sending after the event.
4) I monitor the campaign and look at the data after the campaign finishes for areas of improvement and adjust for future events.
This has been the process for every single marketing campaign I have ever done, regardless of if it is email, ads, phone calls, etc.
However, in my new role instead of doing this this is what has happened.
1) I get the campaign brief of the event.
2) I create the pre-event copy. - They review and ask for specific edits. I make those edits, they then instead of using my copy just go ahead and create their OWN copy and use it instead. They do this without telling me, leaving me waiting for approval to set up the send but they never give it to me until what they made is already sent out.
This is done despite the fact that:
* They don't have demand generation experience
* They don't understand length of emails matter, and send everything as a big blocky text
* They don't understand the importance of certain words in order to optimize open rates
* They don't understand the concepts of Sense of Urgency, Fear of Loss, etc.

So this might just be me, but I feel like over the last couple of years that in new marketing roles you aren't allowed to come up short of expectations at any point before companies try to scrutinize you/get rid of you. This is especially true for newer initiatives, which any marketer will know that your first couple of campaigns will be lower if it's a brand new concept and you have to see what works.
Example:
In my last role I was brought on at an agency and was told there would be multiple clients to work with, but what ended up happening was they put me on one client where it was for events. I have done event promotion and follow up but I never did any of the ordering of supplies, tracking of shipments, etc. Additionally, I was used to talking to clients directly so I can ask directly what they need but for this role I was talking to the main account rep who would relay to me what they needed.
Basically, I did one event and the tracking of shipments wasn't what they wanted. But instead of allowing me to examine areas I could improve on and provide adequate training to improve for future events they instead just let me go after 3 months.
\-------------------
Now in my current role I just started at a place where I am doing post event nurture campaigns, something they have never done before.
I have seen success at a previous position that had lower budgets, but quick response times and more accurate data because it was a smaller company, so I could just do everything myself.
Basically, for the old position since I had more control I could reach out to contacts after a webinar/tradeshow right away. At my new position though, it's highly content on how quickly we get the data back of attendees and how quickly other people can get things set up on there end (I no longer am doing everything to control the funnel, I have to delegate to others).
Because of this, there is a BIG delay on when we can send follow ups, where sometimes we can't send out a first email until 2-3 weeks after they attend (vs my previous gig where it could be done almost next day if we really wanted to).
Because of this, I am having to re-learn and test a lot of processes that would have worked previously but aren't as effective currently based on what I'm seeing.
So naturally, what you would do is look at the data of what you're given, look for things you can adjust/test, and then make changes to improve campaigns going forward to get your numbers up to expectations.
However, I am already getting snippy remarks from people saying things like ""This campaign ONLY generated x signups"" and people are taking the copy I created, disregarding it, and writing it themselves, even though they have never done any kind of post event nurture.
For any other non marketing role, especially a new initiative, I feel like people will understand that you can have experience but st",https://reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1lkb2j2/so_much_of_marketing_is_testing_so_why_are_we/,23,6,0,0,subreddit:marketing,,,"{""subreddit"": ""marketing""}",3000,29,0.0,154,

I got this email, and I want to know if it’s legit. This person is proposing a 3% sales commission and this is what they said (they’re based in Nigeria):
Imagine increasing your store’s visibility, traffic, and conversions without paying a single dollar upfront.
I’m proposing a commission-based collaboration: I help bring more buyers to your store and grow your sales, and I only earn when you do. This isn’t about running ads and hoping for results. It’s about building lasting visibility and sustainable growth, based on how your store appears, performs, and is found by shoppers who are already looking for what you sell.
Here’s the proposed strategy: (Products, Offering, Enhancement);
1. Product
Your product pages aren’t just listings, they’re digital salespeople. If they’re not optimized for how people search, scan, or decide to buy, you’re leaving money on the table.
What I’ll do:
- Rewrite product titles and descriptions to match how real customers search online
- Improve image alt-text, internal linking, and content structure
- Add strategic keywords naturally into product pages and collections
- Make key info easily scannable and persuasive
📌 Goal: Turn product pages into discovery magnets that rank higher and convert better.
2. Offering
Your store’s reputation online matters. When trusted sources mention or link to your site. Google, and your customers start trusting you more.
What I’ll do:
- I'll get your products featured or linked on relevant blogs, product directories, and shopping guides.
- Generate natural backlinks through content collaborations and product reviews
- Create social and third-party presence that reinforces your brand’s value
📌 Goal: Boost your store’s visibility and credibility across the web even outside your own site.
3. Enhancement
Even if your store looks great, if it's slow, confusing, or hard to navigate, visitors bounce. Behind-the-scenes improvements make sure everything loads fast, functions smooth, and ranks strong.
What I’ll do:
- Improve site speed, mobile responsiveness, and core web vitals
- Fix broken links, duplicate content, or messy redirects
- Submit updated sitemaps and make backend tweaks that improve how Google reads your store
Ensure your content structure helps both users and search engines navigate clearly.
📌 Goal: Make sure your store runs clean, fast, and is fully optimized for maximum visibility and usability.
NOTE: All requirements and tools will be provided by you, that's the only role you play as the store owner, I'll do the workings to drive results.
Feel free to ask any questions, or concerns you might want me to address. Would you be interested to proceed with this collaborative idea?

Another AI mini-rant incoming.
I'm not denying it – AI tools helped increase efficiencies across processes in many ways. I get that. But I still believe in using AI in a ""lean"" way, especially in content writing.

We are essentially being plagiarized by bots. That's what's happening. Our patterns of speech, the little quirks and idiosyncrasies, even those are being taken and used to train these bots.
I wrote something 100% original the other day, with zero AI help — just classic, old-school Google research. I ran it through an AI detection tool, and it came back to me with ""55% likely to be AI-generated"".
Then again, you can also argue that AI detection tools should not be taken as seriously as they are. They're faulty and inconsistent, and will flag content from 5-10 years ago as ""likely to be AI-generated."" And why wouldn't they? This is the data that their LLMs were trained on.
Which loops me back to my main point – that we are, to some degree, being plagiarized by language models to generate content, but we're being made to look like *we're* the ones using *their* content.

When I joined my current company, our YouTube brand account was in rough shape - no thumbnails, weak titles, no descriptions, and multiple versions of the same videos in different languages all dumped into a single channel. We manufacture electronic devices for home and commercial use - not really consumer-level gadgets, but more complex systems that require technical expertise to install. That means end-users rarely buy our products directly, but once they’re installed, they stick around for years.
To bring order and improve discoverability, I split the main channel into separate language-specific ones. That move paid off at the time - we saw a huge spike in subscriptions and engagement, especially from regional audiences.
Fast forward three years, and the momentum has clearly dropped. One factor might be the long content gap (we haven’t published anything in over a year, largely due to my maternity leave), but I also wonder if the decline is deeper than that. Has our content become less relevant, or is this part of a broader shift in how people engage with brand channels - especially in more technical, B2B-style industries?
Another factor might be that our content now feels outdated and overly conservative compared to current video trends. Unfortunately, there’s limited room to change that. Our content still follows a very safe formula: Memphis-style animations and AI-generated voiceovers over real people. Attempts to push for more dynamic or trend-aware formats haven’t gained approval from above.
Side note: I must admit I’m not a YouTube pro - I mostly rely on observing what works on better-performing channels and applying that where I can. We’ve recently started experimenting with Shorts, but so far, it hasn’t had much of an impact. We don't really join any RTM trends as it either takes too long for the content team to produce, or our Head of Marketing does not feel it is appropriate.

One of my clients is a private practice in the women’s health space offering a procedure that is very costly ($6500). To keep anonymity, I can’t share much more detail than that because people will find the business.

I have ran social media ads on Facebook generating good leads of our target demographic for only $12-17 a lead. He has grown 20x in the number of forms and interested women wanting the procedure. I have ran way better radio ads which resulted in a direct increase of forms and consultations.
The problem is, he gets hundreds of forms per month, and only does about 10-15 procedures. He wants to get to 20-25 a month. The ONLY reason why women are declining the procedure, is the out of pocket cost. (We’ve polled them). For certain insurances companies (1.5-2.5% of market share) they cover the procedure entirely which is about $6500-6700. However, over 50% of women have government insurance, 30% have the major three health insurance companies, and the rest of women (a fraction) have other minor insurance companies and very few have the “correct” insurance.
Our leads and forms data show that 1-2% have the “good” insurance which almost exactly maps onto the market share data.
My solution was, cast a wider net, broaden the funnel, and specifically mention the good insurance companies and retarget women who engaged with the ads telling them about the insurance offer of zero out of pocket. Also, trying to target higher income earners. Done through organic and paid advertising.
These efforts have resulted in a huge increase of forms, but the problem still remains, nobody has that kind of money even for a truly life changing procedure, and the tiny fraction of insured women with the correct insurance, within the exact demographic of 40-48, and with the symptoms this procedure helps with are extremely hard to find.

So there’s talk (and some internal reports) that Meta is planning to roll out a full-on AI ad system by 2026. Think ChatGPT meets a marketing agency — but it’s trained specifically to generate, test, and optimize ads automatically across Meta platforms. From content creation to targeting and budgeting -the whole pipeline would be automated.
Basically, you’d tell it your product and budget, and Meta’s AI would do everything:
Write and design ads
Target the audience
Adjust bids in real time
Analyze performance and tweak strategy without human input
If this works as well as they claim, it could make traditional marketing agencies irrelevant -at least for businesses that primarily advertise on Instagram, Facebook or WhatsApp
That makes me wonder..
What happens to the thousands of marketing agencies and freelancers out there whose bread and butter is Meta ads?
Do they pivot to just managing the AI tools? Focus on brand-building and strategy outside Meta’s ecosystem? Or do a lot of jobs just disappear?
Also, would you trust Meta’s AI to market your brand -especially when they control both the ad delivery and the optimization logic?
Where does the e-commerce go from there , if the producers of the products don’t need a middleman ? They could just produce and market themselves ..

1 Account Manager - team lead
2 performance marketers - us
1 Creative - graphic artists/translates our ideas to actual creatives.

During the interview i initially thought that I was just gonna come up with content ideas and/or identify the best performing creatives so we can replicate it and the creative person would be the one to actually write it/make it.
Im just having a lot of frustrations cause im not doing good with the role so far because of this and i havent been able to do what i know im good at (which is why i thought i was hired.)

Pre warning: this is going to be a rambly post.
I'm in b2b marketing. For 8 years (my whole career, I'm 27) I've done it all
- brand management
- ABM
- customer marketing
- social
- market research
- paid (search and linkedin)
- content marketing (you name it)
- outbound
- every type of events and webinars
- partner marketing
- graphic design
- website management
- CRM (HubSpot and Salesforce)
- reporting (lead gen, conversion, revenue)
- affiliate and referral management
But honestly? There's not one thing in my career that I can point to as a big highlight.
I've run events that have driven deals - but not many. I've made content thats generated leads - but not a lot.
I've just finished a trade show which I spent 3 months working my butt off for - and it's looking like we're going to miss our lead gen target by a long shot. Our other activities aren't performing to scratch either.
I'm just so tired of trying to be the best at everything - and I'm at a point where I don't have enough love for any of the things I've done to specialise. Sick of being told to focus on one thing at a time - but it never happens in practice because I'm always responsible for everything.
I've always been b2b tech - but across 3 very different audiences over my 8 years, and I've never felt like a real expert in any space, so I can't really lean on that either.
I've switched jobs 3 times in 3 years - I can't see switching again being good for my CV.

Yeah!!! I call this a sign of relief because day by day, it felt like we were heading toward AI doomsday.
*Long post alert.*
The report by the Columbia Journalism Review on AI search tools is crazy.
They compared 8 AI search engines, and all of them are terrible at citing news.
But...
This isn’t just a journalism problem. It’s a marketing problem too. Because these AI tools don’t actually find information, they just repackage it, often without fact-checking the original sources.
Which means:
— Less traffic to publishers
— More incorrect or misleading answers
— Fabricated links to non-existent articles (happens way too often even with the reasoning feature turned on)
And that's not even the worst part. AI tools often *confidently* give wrong answers.
This reminds me of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent AI Summit speech, where he pointed out how AI tools can’t generate an image of someone writing with their left hand. People tested it, but the tools kept defaulting to the right, even when corrected.
Are premium models doing any better???
According to the report, not really. They’re just charging users for more polished misinformation.
And this isn't just a ChatGPT problem. Every major generative search tool tested had the same issues:
— Struggled to retrieve accurate news
— Ignored publisher blocks on web crawling
— Cited syndicated copies instead of original sources
AI search isn't just breaking how we find news or content. It’s distorting it.
We cannot let AI handle verification alone. I’m honestly hesitant to fully trust Perplexity, ChatGPT, or DeepSeek anymore.
AI is NOT replacing human expertise anytime soon, not until we have flawless AI-powered search tools with transparency, accurate citations, and real-time verification.
And even then, it’ll still need a human to oversee it.
This honestly feels like a wake-up call.
I was already getting sick of all the “AI-powered” branding hype anyway.

Marketing and Growth are the lifeblood of any successful business.
You can build the best product, partner with the best vendor, offer the best service &amp; best prices. Doesnt matter. If no one knows you exist, or tests your business, you will not make any money.
Period.
The hard truth?
You must take care of marketing, one way or another.
But also marketing changes, and it changes fast.
What used to work 2 years ago, barely moves the needle today.
If you are not in the tranches, and if you are not constantly testing, experimenting, breaking things, and experiencing the different channels on your own, you are guessing.
And guessing gets expensive.
Ive watched founders burn tens or hundreds of thousands on agencies, hires, paid ads and ""growth hacks"" all based on guess work or some playbook which is a couple years old, or in marketing terms - ""antique"".
Ive been hands-on in the game since keyword stuffing, PBNs and media buying on random websites actually delivered results.

The one marketing channel everyone wants to have because it drives free sales, 0 CAC, LTV:CAC = Infinite.

If we are talking standard SEO = Google Optimization?
Its dead... the funeral happened long ago.
It died the slow death of a thousand cuts of revenue optimization, new formats emerging, shifting content consumption habits, and, of course Googles hunger for more money.
With the emergence of AI as search tools, the market share of Google is dropping, and in the next couple years it will become a secondary search channel.
Google stole the market from Yahoo and Lycos by delivering no-bullshit, intent-matched results.
Straight to the point.
And now.. its 60% fluff, 40% you trying to find what you actually searched for.
No wonder its so much easier just to ask ChatGPT when you have questions and hope that it doesnt halucinate.

How does big corporations create/manage their social media&amp;website accounts and marketing teams?
This question is broken into two parts “security” and “team building”, im looking for feedback for both and an example or experience on how everything was setup for the marketing department in a medium/big company
-the story behind the question-
I’ve been managing several small businesses social media/marketing activities successfully (60 to 200 employees ) but never a this size (over 2000 employees where a hacker targeting the business is more common )
in past week a big company in my country working in ceramic B2B tableware (cups, plates..etc) contacted me to create and manage their accounts (the owner is a close friend to the family) he used to use his personal account as the “business account” and he never really cared about social media but he got hacked (he was freelancing everything with some of my tips in the past) and never really cared about social media but unfortunately due to (many people “freelancers” having access to the account and the fact it’s his “personal accounts” he got hacked and lost access
After weeks of trying i convinced him to consult a well known agency in my country to know what should he do since he wanted to scale in the b2c market, they gave him a list of what they would do but i told him the cost were crazy compared to creating an in-house marketing team so he -I wasn’t really expecting it or trying too- offered me to build the team and became the marketing director possibly a CMO in 2-4 years and manage the B2B business too if everything run smoothly according to the growth plan
My plan after some consultation is like this
1- contact the network and security department/consultancy and setup a password generator/manger that stores the password on our hosts using (enpass)
2-Get a domain name and use it to create the company email
3-create (for example meta) a personal account for the founder&amp; or anyone who can claim the business and use it to create a business accounts
Same goes for other social media accounts and google
•~file to claim and verify ownership
4-setup a social media crm to access the accounts for specific tasks so that the laptops don’t have to save login information
And any attempt to access the accounts would result in sending an email to the c level mangers
5-for the content team, daily fast and fun content (reels, TikToks…etc) that is usually done by phones and require less Rigorous process they would be granted access to a dummy account to do their research and content creation then they would send it to the moderators

*In the beginning was the word, and your word was not yours.*
I still see many creators interact with LLMs like they are a smarter search engine. That’s a mistake.
A prompt is not a query, so it should not be formulated like a query.
A prompt is a brief.
Following Google's release of a detailed [prompt engineering guide](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-prompt-engineering), I want to share a practical breakdown of how to design prompts that give you **(re-)usable, brand-aligned** content—and how to stop getting ""meh"" outputs that need hours of rewriting.
---
## Step 1 – Understand how LLMs [actually](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-prompt-engineering) work
It is painful to see people having used LLMs for years but still fail to understand their inner workings.
After receiving your input (which is treated as a *sequence of tokens*), LLMs **predict the tokens that should come after it**, one by one, based on probability. So when you ask them to write a headline, they’re statistically guessing what *should* come next—based on all the data they’ve been trained on.
Thus, when you submit a prompt to ChatGPT, you do not ""ask"" from it to do something; rather, you *brief to* it the desired output.
Think of the LLM as a **junior writer**.
If you give a vague or unstructured brief, you get generic outputs.
But when you give:
- context
- voice/tone instructions
- examples
- clear formats
...the model starts writing in ways that feel aligned.
---
## Step 2 – Experiment with Battle-Tested Prompt Types
1. **Role prompting** → Helps the model match voice &amp; tone from the start.
*Sample*: “You are a senior B2B copywriter. Your tone is skeptical, concise, and dryly witty.”
2. **Few-shot prompting** → Examples *teach the model the pattern* you want it to follow. Give 3 strong examples, then ask it to write one more.
3. **System + context prompting** → Frames your *task* before the model starts generating.
*Sample*: “Your task is to write meta descriptions for B2B SaaS tools. Focus on clarity and CTR. Limit to 140 characters.”
4. **Chain-of-Thought prompting** → Break down complex content (like landing pages) into manageable logic steps.
*Sample*: “First, list the pain points. Then position the benefit. Then write the CTA.”
---
## Step 3 – Implement Widely-Adopted Best Practices
- Be **directive**, not vague. *“Write a 2-line CTA with urgency for a productivity app.”*
- Use positive instructions over negative constraints. The former *help* the model more accurately understand what it is called to do, without aimlessly pondering on what is permitted.
- Ditch all unnecessary information. If something seems useless or even confusing to you, it is much more so to the model.
- Use **verbs to describe the task at hand**: write, summarize, extract, compare, position, persuade.
- Always **test different prompt structures** (question vs statement vs instruction). Different prompt attrib",https://reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1kimnh0/no_more_prompt_engineering_for_content_marketers/,1,0,0,0,subreddit:marketing,,,"{""subreddit"": ""marketing""}",3000,1,0.0,201,

But here’s the challenge:
When we reach out, especially to managers, they only see ""commission-based = no guaranteed money"" and stop the conversation there. The creators we *have* talked to directly absolutely love the concept and get excited, but even they default to asking for flat fees — even though we’re not asking them to post about us. It’s like they’re so used to the brand-deal model that it’s hard to reframe what we’re offering.
We believe creators *shouldn’t* promote something they don’t believe in or use. We want them to use the tool to grow *their own* income and audience — not ours. So paying flat fees doesn’t make sense for us or them.
Has anyone here cracked this before? How do you *communicate value* when what you're offering is fundamentally different from a sponsorship? How do you reach creators (especially at the micro/mid-tier) *before* their managers shut it down?

Hey fellow builders! 👋
I’m working on **Nextry**, an AI-powered platform that automates the entire marketing workflow for small businesses:
* Generates posts, ad copy, visuals, emails
* Schedules them automatically
* All in less than 30 seconds, with zero agency involvement
Right now I’m wrapping up the MVP and prepping a soft launch. Target users are solo founders, freelancers, and SMB owners who are overwhelmed by marketing and content creation.
I’d love your feedback on a few things:
1. What would *you* expect from a tool like this to make it feel “trustworthy”?
2. Would you pay monthly for it, or prefer a lifetime deal early on?
3. Anything you’ve learned from launching your own SaaS you wish someone told you earlier?

Marketers, a quick heads-up about a frustrating and potentially damaging experience with Google Ads' ""Automatically Created Assets"" (ACA).
Even though we had previously opted out of ACA, it was quietly re-enabled on April 5th. We didn’t realize it until we saw a live ad headline generated by Google that read: “Unprofessional and Unreliable – Unreliable Lawn Service”
This wasn’t a review or user-generated content. This was a paid ad headline Google’s automation wrote for us.
It’s hard to overstate how damaging this could be to a brand. Automation is great when it works, but this crossed a line.
A few takeaways for others:
Double-check your ACA settings, even if you think you’ve opted out.
Keep a close eye on your live ads and previews.
If you’re seeing similar issues, it might be time to bring it up with your Google rep.
Automation should never come at the cost of brand trust. This was a reminder that human oversight is still critical in paid media.

I’m now actively looking for a fully remote job in a SaaS company, ideally based in the US or UK.
Why SaaS? Because I’ve worked with technical industries before. Also, I was pursuing Computer Science Engineering before I dropped out when my interests shifted. However, I do have solid technical knowledge, and I believe it could come in handy in SaaS marketing roles if needed.

* Researching SaaS companies in the US and UK
* Sending cold emails to HRs/founders
* Following up with LinkedIn connections if no response after a few days

In-house marketers, is working alongside an agency a common dynamic, or is it usually a sign you're position is on its way to being eliminated?
I have only ever worked in-house. At my last job, they eventually hired an agency to work alongside me. The agency was awful, spit out 100% AI-generated mess, and my new ""job"" was basically to clean up their work. My boss made me redo almost everything they handed to us. My boss always praised my work. Ultimately the only reason for hiring the agency and keeping them around was because we needed a team to code and maintain for us a new website. I eventually left the company for unrelated reasons.
At my new job, things have been going amazing. They've slowly been increasing my responsibilities, which is great because I'm capable of a lot more than the small content workload they've delegated to me. I've received a lot of praise for my work, and I feel like they've been investing in me (upgrading my technology and tools I need for work, etc.)
However, I'm not even four months in, and there's already talk now about onboarding a marketing agency.
Because of my old job experience, I'm used to that symbiotic relationship, but I also find it pretty useless considering I have a broad skillet and can do everything they're asking this agency to do, of course, sans coding them a website.
The company I work for is also in an extremely niche industry, which really benefits from and needs someone like me to be in-house and boots-on-the-ground to understand and market them effectively.
I feel like this is a replay of my old job because, again, the main reason they are supposedly bringing this agency on board is to redo their website. If that's the case, I can't help but wonder, why not just hire a website designer?
I'm also suspicious of being replaced, because they don't talk about this change to me much, even when I directly press them for info about it and express interest and eagerness to be a part of the decision-making process. As their ""Marketing Specialist,"" who's supposedly going to be working alongside this agency, you'd think my company would want me actively involved in this process and familiarizing myself with the new team. But, no.
They talk about this change constantly amongst themselves, in a hushed tone.
I've also picked up in conversation that, well, they didn't even read my resume upon hiring me. Which signals to me that they just took a chance on me because in the moment, they were desperate to fill the role.
So, what gives? Am I right to be suspicious? Should I be looking for a new job? Or is this common practice, and I'm paranoid?

Let me just start off that I'm not a marketer, abut I have done some SEO work in the past. If my post is not appropriate here, I apologize. It's just always something I've been very curious about.
At the companies I've worked at in the past, I've seen it that they'll have an outside marketing company generate blog posts for them. I know the outside marketing company will run the content by an internal stakeholder (like marketing manager) before running with the post.
Is this typical? I feel like you get ""meh"" level content, but nothing really that interesting. Since it's some copywriter that is just researching on the internet to come up with content.
I've always felt that it would make sense for a copywriter to schedule 30 minutes (or longer) with a one of the subject matter experts (SME) to interview them in order to get information to use for generating blog posts. Like if you're a plastics thermoforming company, interview one of the lead technicians that has been working on it for 30 years. Or if you're a software house, interview one of the more senior coders.
The downside, is that you have an expensive resource (the SME) whose time you're taking up. I feel like the ideal would be to have that SME actually write the blog post themselves, but a lot of people aren't great writers and that would take considerably more time.
The upside to me though would be that you could create thought leaderships blog/content pieces, without a ton of investment. Do companies do this?

Hey guys! Kick off the week with SE Ranking's expert take on the latest SEO trends and AI advancements.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
**Several hot topics are fueling discussions around AI Overviews. Some SEO experts are challenging Google’s statements** about internal algorithm updates affecting link placement timing. Concerns are also mounting over how Google collects and presents its data in public statements.
Barry Schwartz, citing Digiday’s article, *Publishers Don’t Really Know How Google AI Overviews Is Impacting Their Referral Traffic*, explored these issues in depth on Search Engine Roundtable. He highlighted expert analysis from discussions on X, where industry professionals have been closely tracking these developments.
Experts argue that significant changes to link placements within AI Overviews happened later—around August 2024—rather than in May, as Google previously stated. They also question Google’s claim that users who click through AI Overviews spend more time on websites compared to traditional search results, calling for transparency on the data supporting this assertion.
The most debated quote among SEO professionals:
*""A Google spokesperson said Google has made updates since AI Overviews went live last May to add more links and make it easier for people to click those links and visit sites. Those changes include adding in-line links and a right-hand display on desktop that shows links when  previously they would have appeared at the bottom of the AI Overviews feature. The spokesperson also said people who click from search result pages with AI Overviews spend more time on those sites. Google did not provide data to back this up.""*
With so many unanswered questions, the SEO community is pressing for clarity. Stay tuned as we follow these developments closely!

Think flashy campaigns, trendy taglines, and creating buzz for FMCG products. It was all about engagement and brand hype.
Now, I'm at a SaaS tech company with high-value, enterprise-level services. My initial role was to continue managing social media, focusing on culture, events, and thought leadership. But I've also been tasked with building a comprehensive marketing strategy to generate leads and boost awareness.

I'm struggling to reconcile the idea of convincing C-suite executives to invest hundreds of thousands (if not millions) through social media posts and blog content. It feels like a disconnect. I'm new to the B2B space and need guidance.
Currently, I'm considering an account-based marketing (ABM) approach, highlighting target companies and building consistent presence across all channels with value-driven content. I'm also thinking about media outreach, event participation, webinars, LinkedIn lead gen forms, and pushing content to the website for consultation scheduling.
Other tactics I'm exploring include LinkedIn invites, targeted LinkedIn ads, SEO for long-term ROI, and email marketing. The sheer scope of this holistic approach is overwhelming. There's no internal guidance due to the small team and lack of B2B experience. This initiative comes directly from the CEO, adding to the pressure.
I have two weeks to present a strategy and need to start an action plan ASAP. I'm hoping to get advice and tips from anyone who's made the transition from B2C to B2B or has experience in this area. Specifically, I'm looking for insights on:
* Effectively targeting C-level executives in the B2B space.
* Building a robust lead generation funnel for high-ticket services.

I've been running an account based marketing program for the past year and a half, and I use that term loosely because it's really just a list of 300 companies that have been separated out to be targeted on LinkedIn. While it may not seem like much of a plan, I've been able to refine this list and get some high quality leads from some very promising companies. The challenge? They're all mostly ""1 and done"" type leads. They engage with a piece of content, and never engage with us again. What are some tactics you've used to get their attention and nurture them to the mid/bottom of the funnel? Some details on what I'm doing:
* Every lead that comes in gets put into a marketing nurture email workflow, which is mainly ""You might also be interested in this type of content."" There is a lead scoring system in place to measure engagement.
* The sellers have stopped reaching out to any of these leads because they've received very little, if any, response from them. I'm not so much surprised about this, since I don't think they're really looking at their lead score or personalizing the content to what might be of interest. And let's be honest, how many of us actually respond to a sales email? They would be interested in putting in the effort, but it has to be worth their time.

We are a lean team. I am the only demand generation person who does both strategy and execution. We no longer have a content person or designer, so resources are limited. I don't have a large budget to buy all these fancy intent data programs. I know that true ABM is highly personalized, which we're doing none of right now. Is there a way to effectively do this but also making it easy for the sales team to utilize while minimizing the effort on my end? (Like I can't be creating personalized landing pages for every lead that comes through, but it would be nice if there was some type of program that the sales team could use to better personalize their outreach.)

Here are **5 psychological triggers** that make people take action (and how you can use them in your marketing):
📌 **Key Takeaways:**
✔ **Scarcity:** Ever noticed how “Only 3 left in stock!” makes you rush to buy? That’s FOMO in action. Scarcity creates urgency. Use it wisely in limited-time offers and stock alerts.
✔ **Curiosity:** Headlines like “You won’t believe what happened next” make people **stop scrolling**. The secret? Open loops that make the brain crave closure. Use this in ad copy &amp; emails.
✔ **Social Proof:** Would you rather try a product with 5,000 reviews or 5? People follow the crowd. Use testimonials, case studies, and UGC (user-generated content) to build trust.
✔ **Reciprocity:** Ever wondered why brands give away free trials? When people receive something valuable for free, they feel inclined to return the favor, whether by purchasing or engaging.
✔ **Authority:** Why do we trust a dentist’s toothpaste recommendation over a random ad? People trust experts.

I've seen so many opinions on this and every post is slightly different so I'm hoping to post our situation for some actionable advice.
Context: My career was in sales mostly, I pivoted to product marketing, and now (at my startup) I've taken on a temporary growth marketing hat. Because of this, I want to help shape some of our reporting but I'm not 100% familiar with how it's typically done.
That said, it doesn't look like my company has any conversion funnels set up outside of Hubspot. We use Salesforce (but lots of our dashboards are made in Sigma). I'm currently working with our RevOps team to mirror Hubspot and Salesforce MQLs (we don't need to get into this but they had a different scoring model until this week). Our MQLs in Salesforce seem closer to what our north start should be, they are form fills for inbound leads (from our contact us page) as well as form fills for our webinar sign ups (our next largest lead generator). We also get leads from paid social campaigns and content downloads but this number is much smaller and the intent is much lower.
So I'm wondering how best to parse this out in something like a Salesforce report. My gut instinct is to have a funnel report of:
\- all MQLs (inbound write-ins, webinar signs ups, leads from paid social campaigns)
\- SQLs (we don't have SALs because the volume is so low, the sales reps reach out to everyone)
\- Opportunity
\- Closed
But what I'm wondering is if we shouldn't include webinar/social leads in the MQL bucket? I feel like it's diluting the top of funnel number. Alternatively I was thinking we could have it this way and then just look at conversion via campaign reports?

reddit,1j3ctdj,whocares1800,whocares1800,2025-03-04T15:06:31+00:00,"The Fake MMS Marketing Funnel That’s Exploiting Women in India
For years, videos claiming to be “leaked MMS” of innocent women have circulated online.
Most people ignore them. Some believe them.
Few realize that they are part of a sophisticated marketing scam that exploits curiosity, social engineering, and digital loopholes to make money.
Who are the victims?
Some of the women falsely linked to these fake leaks include:
- Subashree Sahu
- Payal Shah
- Zara Dar
- Ritika Kharel
- Sapna Shah
These women did not record any explicit videos, yet their names and faces have been dragged into one of the most dangerous and unethical marketing scams in India today.
Today, I am breaking this funnel down in detail so people can understand how it works, why it’s effective, and how it can be stopped.
Step 1: Identifying &amp; Targeting Victims
The scammers search Instagram and YouTube Shorts for women who have:
- Public accounts
- Visible faces and bodies (makeup videos, dance videos, casual fashion content)
- Engagement (likes, comments, shares)
These women may have posted nothing explicit, but their videos are clipped, edited, and repurposed to make it seem like an actual MMS exists.
99% of these “leaked MMS” are completely fake.
But the damage is immediate. Once the rumor starts, the woman’s name starts circulating in Telegram groups, search engines, and social media.
People begin speculating, gossiping, and harassing the victim, making it almost impossible to stop the spread.
Step 2: The Clickbait Trap on Instagram &amp; YouTube
These scams primarily operate on platforms where users spend the most time:
- Instagram Reels
- YouTube Shorts
Scammers create short videos with:
Sensational thumbnails (blurred images, fake “screenshots”)
Misleading captions (“Leaked video of [victim’s name]! Click the link!”)
Fake comments claiming that people have already watched the video.
The key psychological trigger being used here is curiosity—leveraging the power of ""NEW.""
🚨 The phrase ""Iska bhi MMS leak ho gaya"" creates a false sense of urgency that makes people click.
The scam is entirely dependent on this one emotion. The moment someone believes a new MMS is out, they rush to click without thinking.
At this stage, many people fall for it and click the link.
Step 3: Redirecting to Telegram
Since Instagram and YouTube do not allow adult content links, scammers redirect traffic to Telegram.
Users are told:
- “The full video is in our private Telegram group.”
- “Only members can access the leaked video.”
- “Join before it’s deleted.”
Once inside the Telegram group, thousands of fake comments make it appear as though the video is real.
Meanwhile, Telegram pays group admins once they reach 1,000+ members, so scammers profit just by growing the audience.
Step 4: The Fake App Download
Instead of actually seeing any MMS, users are asked to download a specific app to “access the video.”
TeraBox 1024GB is the most commonly used apps in this scam.
Why? Because these apps pay per do",https://reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1j3ctdj/the_fake_mms_marketing_funnel_thats_exploiting/,0,0,0,0,subreddit:marketing,,,"{""subreddit"": ""marketing""}",3000,0,0.0,267,

John Mueller responded to a Reddit thread about a 'noindex detected in X-Robots-Tag HTTP header' error showing in Google Search Console—even though the affected pages didn't have the X-Robots-Tag or similar directives.
He noted this could be caused by misconfigurations, caching issues, or other technical factors not immediately visible. Mueller advised webmasters to review their site's HTTP headers, ensure no conflicting directives are set, and review the server-side settings to resolve this issue.

Happy Friday, everyone! AI is evolving at an incredible pace, and we can’t imagine a more fascinating topic to follow right now. Some see it as a major concern (let us know if you feel the same), while others welcome the ways it simplifies their lives.
So, we’ve gathered the latest AI news and are ready to share it with you:

***AI Overviews continue to push the boundaries of information retrieval with AI-driven results.*** The SEO community is actively sharing screenshots and videos of AI-generated snippets that reference dozens of web sources. And we’re not just talking about 20 links—SEO specialists are seeing cases where AI Overviews generate link clusters with 40+ sources.
The most notable discussions right now come from Lily Ray and Glenn Gabe. They were among the first in the SEO community to highlight this new iteration of AI Overviews, bringing it into the spotlight. Their posts quickly caught the attention of Barry Schwartz, who shared his take via Search Engine Roundtable:
*""I mean, if the AI Overview had maybe 3 to 5 links, sure, maybe a searcher will accidentally click on one of those links. But an AI Overview with 40, 50, 60 plus links. That is way too overwhelming and no searcher will click on those.""*
The SEO and marketing community keeps pointing out how AI-generated elements affect organic performance—ironically, on the same pages that provide the content for these AI snippets. It’s interesting to see how different sides of the search game react to these updates, weighing the good and the bad of whatever the search giant rolls out next.
Google often puts its boldest innovations to the test by rolling them out directly and gathering user feedback. Optimization typically follows, meaning what we’re seeing now is likely an early-stage version. We’ll be sure to keep a close eye on future updates and cover them in our upcoming digests.

I (23F) am interested in starting a digital marketing agency that specializes in Social Media Management &amp; Strategy Development.
I graduated in Dec 2023 with a Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration with a specialization in Marketing. Since graduation, I have struggled to find a job due to my lack of experience and have considered going back to school to get my masters degree to help me find something.
I currently manage 3 social media accounts:
- A clothing boutique (small business)
- 2 restaurants/nightclubs
My responsibilities for the boutique include:
- Content creation. I film and photograph all of the content for social media and create graphics in Canva.
- Social media strategy. I employ various marketing strategies that align with the brand goals (grow brand awareness and get people to come in the store). This includes planning various promotions and sales, running social media advertisements, adhering to a content calendar, planning and promoting special events, partnering with other local businesses for giveaways/specials, partnering with influencers etc.
- Analysis. I conduct A/B testing on social media ads through adjusting content types and target audience.
- Managing all social media accounts (Engaging with followers, responding to DMs, etc.)
- Creating a Shopify website. I’m currently leading the project of setting up e-commerce through Shopify.
I’m essentially responsible for every aspect of marketing for this business which has provided me with a lot of valuable experience, especially because I had 0 experience going into it. I’ve been successful in growing the business’s social media presence and my social media marketing skills have directly correlated to a growth in sales.
My responsibilities for the 2 restaurants/nightclubs include:
- Creating a content schedule for each location and posting in sync with upcoming events and such.
- Creating marketing strategies that align with each location (Both restaurants are owned by the same company but have different atmospheres/business goals so they require different marketing strategies).
- I am NOT responsible for creating the content, but rather coordinating with their graphic designer and photographers to curate content.
- Managing both social media accounts.
- Generating leads for table reservations.
- Coordinating with influencers and other local businesses.
- Running social media ads, tracking performance, and analyzing metrics.
- Creating giveaways and other promotions.
- Working with management and owners to align marketing strategies with business goals.
I just started this job today but I will be getting paid $400 a week for each restaurant ($800 a week).
Since I have been given this second opportunity, it has inspired me to potentially start my own social media marketing agency. Technically I’m just doing freelance work at the moment, but I feel like I could make this grow into something su",https://reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1it1gfe/is_it_worthwhile_for_me_to_try_to_create_my_own/,1,0,0,0,subreddit:marketing,,,"{""subreddit"": ""marketing""}",3000,1,0.0,280,

Hey guys! This week’s SEO news isn’t just for SEOs—it’s packed with insights for all marketers. A lot has happened in the digital world over the past week… Let’s break it down:
**Updates**
No official algorithm updates yet.
**Search / SEO**
* **Google Search Boosts Speed by 60ms with New Pre-Fetching Method**
We can now observe improvements in search speed through new pre-fetching methods. This approach, which uses the Speculation Rules API, reduced the Largest Contentful Paint for the first two results by 67 milliseconds on Chrome for Android. The desktop version saw similar gains, with a 58.6 millisecond reduction in LCP.
Additionally, for results beyond the first two, the First Contentful Paint was reduced by 7.6 milliseconds and LCP by 9.5 milliseconds.
These enhancements aim to deliver a faster, more efficient user experience when navigating Google search results—particularly for mobile users.
* **Google Image Search May Be Downranking AI-Generated Images**
There is growing speculation in the SEO community that Google Image Search may be downranking AI-generated images in favor of non-AI images. Reports from various sources, including charts shared by Zack Notes, indicate a significant drop in image traffic in late January 2025, particularly for AI-generated content.
Some experts believe Google has introduced a quality metric that influences how AI-generated images are ranked compared to other images. While some users have confirmed similar declines in rankings, others suggest that multiple Google Image updates could be related to AI-generated content. Despite these observations, not all websites—even those featuring AI-generated hero images—have experienced the same drop in rankings.

**SERP features / Interface**
* **(test) Google Tests New 'Page Includes' Snippet in Search Results**
Google is testing a new snippet in its search results called “page includes.” This feature automatically pulls additional information from webpages and includes it in the snippet for certain search queries.
For example, users searching for “laptops” might see unrelated data such as stock prices, which has raised concerns about the accuracy and relevance of the information displayed. Some users have expressed dissatisfaction with the feature, noting that it can present inaccurate details that may confuse or mislead them.
* **(test) New Filters for Latest Posts Carousel on Google**
The new feature, which adds filters to the ""Latest Posts"" carousel, allows users to sort posts by specific platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, X, and Facebook. This update aims to enhance the content discovery experience by providing an easy way for users to find posts from their preferred platform.

I run a small IT services company (15 employees, 3 of them in sales) and have a clear need for a dedicated marketing person. Marketing is not my area of expertise so I would appreciate any input on what some realistic expectations are for the position. Some of the tasks that I envision include:
* Posting content to social media and our website ""blog"" (we have access to content through a service, but it has to be branded)
* Branding - I have several ideas around doing this but need creative execution
* Generating original online marketing content, most likely in the form of simple, short videos and 1-4 panel comic strips (same as the branding, I have several ideas on what the content should look like).
* Standardizing the ""look"" of our forms
* Creating marketing materials such as flyers for our products and services
* Organizing and MCing quarterly events
* Updating website content and SEO (we have external contractors to help with the nuts &amp; bolts)
* Helping create and execute creative marketing campaigns for current and future prospects. As an example, another company in our industry sent 50 good prospects a custom puzzle with 1 piece missing, and they could only get the missing piece by agreeing to an in-person meeting.

Guys, overhyped or not, when a little-known Chinese AI model suddenly dethrones ChatGPT in the Apple Store charts, it’s time to start paying attention. A quick Google search on DeepSeek reveals a rabbit hole of divided opinions. Some celebrate it for its cost-effectiveness, while others warn of legal and privacy concerns. But all seem to agree on one thing: DeepSeek can do almost anything ChatGPT can do.
For all digital marketers, DeepSeek is worth a closer look. But don’t ignore the security and privacy alarm bells ringing around the globe. It’s not pretty.
So what exactly is DeepSeek, and why should you care?
***5 Key Takeaways***
* DeepSeek’s R1 model challenges the notion that AI must cost a fortune in training data to be powerful.
* Cheap API access to GPT-o1-level capabilities means SEO agencies can integrate affordable AI tools into their workflows without compromising quality. Its online version and app also have no usage limits, unlike GPT-o1’s pricing tiers.
* Most SEOs say GPT-o1 is better for writing text and making content whereas R1 excels at fast, data-heavy work.
* A cloud security firm caught a major data leak by DeepSeek, causing the world to question its compliance with global data protection standards.
* DeepSeek’s censorship due to Chinese origins limits its conte
# Training &amp; Cost Efficiency
One of the biggest differences between DeepSeek R1 and ChatGPT is their training structure. DeepSeek R1 was trained using a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, activating only part of its 236B parameters at a time, making it highly cost-efficient.
In contrast, ChatGPT-4 (likely using a combination of MoE and dense models) operates on a much larger budget, which allows it to handle a wider variety of tasks with higher accuracy but at a greater computational cost.
# Performance &amp; Capabilities
**Coding &amp; Logic:** DeepSeek R1 outperforms ChatGPT-3.5 in code-related tasks and logical problem-solving. However, GPT-4 remains the best AI for complex reasoning and multi-step problem-solving.
**Creativity &amp; Content Generation:** When it comes to writing long-form content, creative writing, and nuanced responses, ChatGPT-4 leads the way, producing more coherent and natural-sounding text. DeepSeek R1, though competent, falls short in generating human-like responses with depth and style.
**Mathematical &amp; Technical Queries**: DeepSeek performs well in math-heavy and technical fields, but ChatGPT-4 still dominates in general knowledge and balanced responses.
# Security &amp; Censorship Issues
One of DeepSeek R1’s biggest challenges is content censorship. Being China-based, it actively avoids politically sensitive topics and may redirect conversations on controversial subjects. Additionally, a recent security breach exposed its backend data, raising concerns about user privacy.
ChatGPT, on the other hand, adheres to OpenAI’s content moderation policies, but it i",https://reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1iohbbq/deepseek_costeffective_ai_for_seos_or_overhyped/,9,4,0,0,subreddit:marketing,,,"{""subreddit"": ""marketing""}",3000,13,0.0,286,

**Updates**
No official algorithm updates yet.

**Search / SEO**
* **AI Overviews Introduces Detailed Comparison Mode for Product Searches**
Making decisions has never been easier. Google’s new AI Overview feature introduces a detailed comparison mode for product searches. For example, if you search for ""iPhone 15 vs iPhone 15 Pro,"" Google provides a side-by-side breakdown directly within the AI Overview, showcasing specifications and other essential details for both products.
This functionality empowers users to evaluate large amounts of product data without leaving the search page. While these overviews engage users effectively, their click-through rate remains low. On average, AI Overview results account for just 4% of clicks, compared to higher engagement levels seen with traditional snippets.
* **AI Overviews Are Hurting Click-Through Rates**
A study conducted by Seer found that AI Overviews significantly reduce CTRs for both organic and paid search results. Analyzing 10,000 keywords with informational intent, the study revealed a sharp decline in CTRs when AI Overviews appeared in search results.
Although Google claims AI Overviews drive more user engagement and clicks, the data tells a different story. Glenn Gabe’s analysis showed that AI Overview results captured only about 4% of clicks—a figure considerably lower than the CTRs typically seen for traditional search results or featured snippets.

* **(test) New 'AI Mode' in Search for Open-Ended Queries**
Google is testing a new ""AI Mode"" in search, designed to address open-ended and exploratory queries that traditional search results struggle to handle. Powered by Gemini 2.0, this feature introduces a chatbot-like interface, allowing users to ask detailed or follow-up questions. Answers are presented in a clear, user-friendly breakdown.
Currently, Google employees in the US are piloting the AI Mode, with its official launch anticipated later in 2025.

You can now test the new ""Share List"" button for local search results on Google Search. This feature, available in local packs and business pages, allows users to easily share discovered locations with others, such as friends or colleagues.
It can be especially useful for collaboratively researching local businesses or places.

I’m sharing this because it’s important for both potential employees and brands to understand what they’re getting into. On platforms like TrustPilot and Glassdoor, negative reviews seem to get buried under an influx of five-star reviews, so I want to provide some transparency.
# For Creative Strategists / Creative Directors:
If you’re considering working here, be aware that the **pay structure has recently changed**—shifting from **$35 an hour to a flat $350 per client** (depending on the base pay tier you’re placed in). This effectively **caps you at 10 hours per client**, regardless of how much work is actually required. Some workers have found that **even if assigned seven clients, they may only be compensated for all seven, only the five based on their pay tier.**
The company also **offers a $350 retention bonus for every client you keep past three months**, but it appears to be paid out only after each full three-month period. While this is positioned as an incentive for quality, it may also create additional pressure.
# Work Expectations Include:
* Writing **24 unique ad scripts per month**.
* Managing **communications with creators, editors, and clients**.
* Reviewing creator footage and **overseeing edits from overseas editors** that often require extra direction.
* Using an **AI script generator** that produces copy many clients find **repetitive or unnatural**.
* **Providing input to refine AI-generated scripts**, which some believe is being used to build intellectual property for future monetization.
Many workers feel this **pay structure does not fairly reflect the workload**. Additionally, some have raised concerns that their **strategic contributions** may be used to develop AI-driven tools that could **further reduce the need for human input over time**.
Beyond workload and pay, there is a **culture of fear**—many workers feel uncomfortable asking questions or pushing back on **tight deadlines and high expectations** out of concern for **negative feedback from leadership.** The company does **not offer structured skill development or mentorship**, though recently, they began providing “free” access to a new course. While this is framed as a benefit, some employees feel it does not replace **fair compensation or career growth opportunities**.
# For DTC Brands Considering UGC Factory:
With this new pay structure, it’s worth **asking questions** before partnering with the company. Creative Directors are **limited to 10 hours per client**, meaning their time and creative energy must be divided across multiple brands under strict constraints.
Some clients have raised **concerns about the quality and authenticity of content**, particularly with UGC creators. If you prioritize **high-quality, original creative strategy**, it may be worth **clarifying how much time is dedicated to your brand and how content is developed.**

I have a published author who wants a website and marketing for his author business. Website will be its own separate fee and then he wants to do a rev share on the book sales and speaking engagements in exchange for marketing. Below are some of the rough details. Have any of you done a trade like this with an author before and how did you/would you split it? If you did a tiered rev share, how would you structure that? For reference, he has been self-publishing books and doing speaking engagements for a couple of decades without much revenue. He is a great writer and speaker (has been a professor for decades) but has done absolutely no marketing so his sales are very minimal. I have 13 years of experience in marketing, but never structured a contract quite like this one for an author before. Thank you for your insights!

Hey everyone!
I'm co-owner of a design studio that provides brand identity services.
Staring price is USD4800 and average project price is USD6000ish.
Up until now we are acquiring leads by creating Instagram content, and doing some commercial campaigns there.
Because of this, the number of leads we receive really depends to how much we can dedicate ourselves to content production and to commercial campaigns (we still have a lot of fulfilling to do), and makes lead generation inconsistent.
I was thinking about how to have a consistent flow of leads coming in, and came with two options:
1. Content Distribution Funnel
Producing our content in a way that we have different depths of consciousness, with the last layer making a pitch for a call.
Running those through ads in a way that we take the colder audience, take through all layers of content ending with the pitch.
2. Creating a Direct Sales funnel
Creating a direct sales funnel, Russel Brunson style, starting with a lead magnet (ebook or webinar probably), and pitching for the upsell that would be our brand identity service.
Both options would allow us to run this consistently and regardless of content creation (after initial set of advertising creatives is generated at least).
I would like to hear opinions from ppl that already implemented either, both, or at least is familiar with either.

I run a small company in the mental health field. Our products are therapy, coaching, and access to some course content (videos, self-help workbooks, etc). So far it’s been just me, and it’s been very profitable and successful. I’m expanding my product offering significantly. Right now, my marketing  budget is about $1,000 for SEO and $2,000 for Google Ads. have an SEO consultant I’m paying. I also have a Google Ads consultant, but I’m not including him in this analysis because I don’t see his role changing. The Google Ads I’m running myself. I have good personal experience in Google Ads from a previous business. The Google Ads have a good price per lead: about $200 per lead which equates to $600 per client/sale and about 10 leads a month. The SEO is also generating about 10 leads a month and has slowly ramped up over the past two years since I’ve been doing SEO.  So currently in total I spend $3,000 for 20 leads or $150 per lead.
I’ve got about $50,000 earmarked for marketing spend to spend over four months as I launch my new expansion. That $50K includes both “one time” investment (consultants, strategy, website work, etc) and recurring monthly costs during this implementation phase. This marketing spend will be invested over a period of four months. By the end of the four months, I’d like to be at a steady state with double the amount of leads from previously, ie about 40 leads per month. I’m willing to double the cost I’ll allow for a lead up to $300 per lead.
More context, I have a valuable email list of about 1,000 emails of past leads or contacts that filled out information forms. I tried a couple email blasts but got a very poor open rate and gave up. Peer to peer therapist marketing is not a bad strategy (the other therapist might have a client they can refer), but I haven’t tried much. I have over 10 hours of content that I could have someone pick apart to push a reels/tiktok/youtube shorts campaign. I could also build a good youtube channel. I tried facebook marketing, but it wasn’t profitable. I built my website myself. It’s decent but not great. Part of my budget was going to be allocated to a website polish and strategist to help me with the pitch, landing page, product offering, etc. Of everything I’ve tried, Google ads is most dependable but the more I spend, the less efficient it gets. I’m not sure how much more I can go.
How would you spend the $50,000 budget? I’m thinking about 2/3 of that will be in “investment/experimentation” and 1/3 of that will be in recurring monthly ppc/seo.  I’m a DIY guy but I don’t know if I have the time or expertise to optimize this process. Should I plan it myself or should I find a great consultant with experience in niche therapy/coaching/course content marketing and turn the strategy over?
