1p5oald,Need career guidance,"Rn, I'm working with an agency in a role that im thinking of changing. I'm thinking of shifting my direction to content strategy. Should I make decks on LinkedIn and post?

Can concepts generated by AI be claimed by an individual if they have given their inputs? 

I do have some creative ideas that come by sometimes. I think it will come more naturally if I'm deeper into this space. What do you think?

1p0jata,Career Day: Middle School Edition,"TL;DR:  
I’m speaking to three groups of middle schoolers on Career Day about what marketing actually is. I want it to be fun, interactive, and relevant to their real lives (social media, ads, influence, choices, etc.). Looking for your expert ideas: What would you teach kids about marketing? What concepts matter most? What examples or hands-on activities would keep them engaged?

Before I dive in, yes, I used ChatGPT to help structure this post. But the ask is very real, and every idea here is mine. I brain-dumped four pages in a Google Doc of what I want to cover, what I want the students to learn, and the interactive elements I want to build. I’m just using AI to help present it clearly so I can get solid feedback from people who actually work in marketing, you.

I’ve been invited to speak at a local middle school for their Career Day, and I’ll be presenting to three groups of up to 28 students, each for about 25 minutes. I’ll be covering what I do as a marketing professional/freelancer/consultant, and I’m trying to craft something that’s both engaging and actually useful for kids this age.

Being middle schoolers, I want to keep things visual, interactive, and fun, but grounded in real marketing fundamentals. I’d love to hear from this community what you believe is vital to present to middle schoolers and might be relevant to them today. Things like how marketing affects their ideas and decisions, what they buy and use, and even how they see topics like politics, identity, and trends.

# What I’m thinking so far:

# 1. Start with the question “What is marketing?”

I expect basic answers like: Ads, Commercials, Trying to sell stuff, Logos, Social media influencers, or Coupons.

# 2. Give a simple overview of marketing types.

Thinking of covering:

* Traditional marketing, Digital marketing, Product marketing, Brand marketing, Content marketing, PR 

Anything missing or better for this age group?

# 3. Hammer home the most underrated part of marketing: research.

My main lesson:

Your assumptions are usually wrong without user research.

I’m planning to do a quick live “user research test” with show-of-hands questions to reveal unexpected truths. Examples I’m considering:

* “Pick your favorite snack from these four options.”
* “Which of these logos looks the most trustworthy?”
* “Which thumbnail would you click?”
* A fast ‘NPS-style’ question—e.g., ‘On a scale of 0–10, how likely are you to recommend this school to a friend?’ or ‘How likely are you to recommend \[a fun, school-appropriate teacher\]?’
   * Then showing how marketers categorize detractors/passives /promoters and why it matters. 

If anyone has run an exercise like this with students (or adults!), what questions worked best?

# 4. Show a &lt;1 min clip from a marketing thought leader.

Preferably something reinforcing:  
“Marketing isn’t just colors and shapes, it’s critical thinking.”

Leaning toward Kotler, Ogilvy, and Ritson(because his videos are easy to consume). Other recs?

# 5. Show good and bad marketing examples.

Including ones they already interact with:

* Fast food, Shoes, YouTube, Gaming, TikTok

Also want one example of “great marketing for a bad product,” but school-appropriate.

# 6. End with: “The future of marketing and what it means for YOU.”

Topics like:

* AI
* Personalization
* Influencers
* Algorithmic shaping of choices
* How marketing affects identity and worldview 

# What I need from you all:

1. What would you teach middle schoolers about marketing?
2. What’s essential to cover that I might be missing?
3. Any great interactive or hands-on ideas?
4. Good questions for a quick user research demo?
5. Any short, punchy thought-leader clips to recommend?
6. School-safe examples of “good marketing for a bad thing”? 

I want this to be fun, memorable, and genuinely eye-opening for them.

This community has been an incredible help throughout my career, and I appreciate your thoughts on what to teach the next generation!",remixclashes,marketing,1763489529.0,1,1,1,https://reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1p0jata/career_day_middle_school_edition/,https://reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1p0jata/career_day_middle_school_edition/,False,Discussion,True,2025-11-26T05:24:19.167673+00:00
1ouf0dj,Are marketing jobs shrinking?,"I attended an event last week, where a veteran marketer said: ""You are either 10x, or you get replaced by AI."" By ""10x"" he meant, one marketer should be able to do the job of 10.

  
His statement was mainly towards content writers because generative AI seemed to have chased down their jobs first

  
But I think it is relevant for marketers overall, which creates a dilemma for me: If I equip myself with AI and do the job of 10 other marketers, I am replacing 9 marketers

1op35fu,Tired of writing case studies that nobody reads? I built a prompt that fixes that.,"Hey everyone,

Ever tried writing a business case study that actually convinces decision-makers?

You spend hours gathering data, interviewing stakeholders, and trying to structure everything logically. You write what you think is a compelling narrative... but it comes out either too academic or too salesy. Investors skim it, clients ignore it, and you're left wondering why your hard work isn't getting results.

I've been there too many times. The gap between what we think makes a good case study and what actually persuades business audiences is massive. Most advice out there is either super basic (""tell a good story"") or so complicated you need an MBA to implement it.

So I did what any rational business professional would do: analyzed hundreds of successful case studies, studied what actually drives decision-making, and built a comprehensive prompt that turns ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Grok into a professional business analyst and case study writer.

This isn't ""write me a case study about X"" that gives you generic, forgettable content. This is a complete framework covering everything from data-driven storytelling to measurable outcomes.

---

## Why This Actually Helps

**Most people approach AI like this:**
""Write a case study about our successful project.""

**What they get back:**
Generic content that looks like every other business school assignment.

**This prompt system is different because it's built on actual business communication best practices:**

**1. Complete Structure, Not Just Content**
- Executive summary that captures attention in 150-200 words
- Company background with strategic context
- Challenge analysis with business impact quantification
- Solution approach with step-by-step implementation
- Results &amp; metrics with before/after comparisons
- Lessons learned with actionable insights
- Future implications and recommendations

**2. Data-Driven Requirements Built-In**
The prompt forces AI to include:
- Specific metrics and KPIs with actual numbers
- Before/after comparisons with percentages
- Timeline specifications with clear milestones
- Quantifiable business impact (revenue, efficiency, satisfaction)
- Verifiable outcomes that build credibility

**3. Professional Storytelling Framework**
Not just ""tell a story."" The prompt teaches AI to:
- Use the HERO framework (Hook-Engage-Resolve-Outcome)
- Balance technical depth with accessibility
- Include stakeholder quotes for authenticity
- Add visual element suggestions (charts, graphs)
- Maintain professional but engaging tone throughout

**4. Multiple Business Scenarios Covered**
Whether you're doing:
- Product launch case studies
- Digital transformation projects
- Crisis management situations
- Process improvement initiatives
- Customer success stories
- Investment pitch validations

The prompt adapts with specific guidelines for each type.

**5. Quality Control Built-In**
- Self-assessment checklist for each output
- Professional standards verification
- Data accuracy requirements
- Format compliance checks
- Audience appropriateness validation

---

## What You Actually Get

✅ **Professional case study** ready for investor presentations, client proposals, or academic publications

- Executive summary (150-200 words)
- Company background and context

✅ **Quality checklist** to verify professional standards

✅ **Advanced optimization techniques** for maximum impact

✅ **Real examples** showing what works vs. what doesn't

## Real Talk - What This Is and Isn't

**What this IS:**
- A comprehensive framework based on actual business communication best practices
- Professional-grade structure that investors and clients expect
- A tool to dramatically improve your case study creation process
- Free to use and modify for your business needs
- Built on analysis of real case studies that drove decisions

**What this is NOT:**
- A magic formula that guarantees investment or client approval
- A replacement for having actual business results and data
- An excuse to create fictional case studies without substance
- A shortcut that eliminates need for strategic thinking

The truth: This prompt gives you professional structure and optimization. You still need to bring your actual business data, genuine insights, and real results. The prompt handles technical excellence—you provide the substance.

## Pro Tips for Maximum Impact

- Gather accurate metrics before starting
- Verify all numbers and percentages
- Collect specific examples and anecdotes
- Document timeline milestones precisely

**2. Know Your Audience**
Different audiences need different emphasis:
- **Investors**: ROI, market size, competitive advantage
- **Clients**: Problem-solving, reliability, partnership value
- **Academics**: Methodology, theoretical contributions, citations
- **Internal teams**: Lessons learned, process improvements, best practices

**3. Storytelling Techniques**
Even with great structure, storytelling makes it memorable:

- Include stakeholder quotes for authenticity
- Add specific moments of tension or breakthrough
- End with clear implications and forward-looking statements

**4. Visual Enhancement**

- Charts showing before/after metrics

- **Missing context**: Not explaining why the challenge mattered
- **Weak conclusions**: Generic takeaways vs. specific strategic insights
- **Poor flow**: Sections that don't connect logically
- **Inconsistent tone**: Switching between academic and casual styles

---

## A Few Important Notes

**About AI-generated case studies:**
- Always review and personalize the output
- Verify all data points against your actual records
- Ensure the story aligns with your brand and values
- The prompt provides structure, not the business insights themselves

**About results:**
- No prompt guarantees that your case study will achieve specific business outcomes
- Quality of your actual business results still matters most
- This is a tool to improve communication, not create fictional success
- Professional presentation + real data = credible case study

**Privacy reminder:**
- Don't paste confidential company data into public AI tools
- Use anonymized data or generic examples if needed
- Review output to ensure no sensitive information is included

---

## My Experience With This

I use this system for all client case studies and investor updates now. Here's what changed:

**Before**: Generic narratives that failed to highlight key metrics, inconsistent structure, missed the ""so what"" factor that decision-makers need.

**After**: Professional case studies that get forwarded, generate follow-up questions, and actually help close deals or secure buy-in.

The biggest benefit isn't just time saved—it's having a proven framework that ensures every case study hits the key decision-making criteria: clear problem statement, specific solution approach, measurable results, and actionable insights.

I no longer wonder if my case studies are ""good enough""—I know they follow the structure that business professionals expect and respond to.

---

## Why This Matters for Your Business

Good case studies aren't just documentation—they're strategic assets that:

- **Build credibility** with investors, clients, and partners
- **Demonstrate expertise** without sounding arrogant
- **Provide social proof** that your solutions actually work
- **Create reusable content** for marketing, sales, and recruiting
- **Support decision-making** with clear, data-driven evidence

Whether you're a startup founder seeking investment, a consultant proving your value, or an enterprise leader documenting success, this prompt system helps you communicate your achievements professionally and persuasively.

1one6at,I crafted the perfect press release prompt. Here's the complete system that actually gets media coverage.,"Hey everyone,

Ever tried writing a press release that actually gets picked up by journalists? 

You spend hours researching what makes a story newsworthy. You draft something that looks professional. You send it out... and crickets. Maybe one small blog mentions it, but no real media coverage. No journalist calls, no interviews, no actual impact.

I've been there too many times. The gap between what we think journalists want and what they actually need is massive. Most press release advice out there is either super basic (""write a good headline"") or so complicated you need a PR degree to implement it.

So I did what any rational marketer would do: analyzed hundreds of successful press releases, studied what actually gets coverage, and built a comprehensive prompt that turns ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Grok into a professional PR strategist.

This isn't ""write me a press release"" that gives you generic, forgettable content. This is a complete framework covering everything from newsworthiness analysis to media-friendly formatting.

## Pro Tips for Better Results

**1. Newsworthiness First**

- Is this actually news?
- Who cares about this and why?
- What's the timing relevance?
- What's the human impact?

**2. Data Points Matter**
Journalists love specific, verifiable information:
- Include actual numbers and statistics
- Provide concrete examples or case studies
- Quote real people with real titles
- Reference third-party validation when possible

**3. Build Relationships**
Even the perfect press release works better when you have:
- Existing relationships with relevant journalists
- Understanding of their beats and interests
- Timing awareness for their editorial calendars
- Professional follow-up etiquette

**4. Quality Over Quantity**
One excellent press release that gets coverage is better than:
- Ten generic releases that get ignored
- Mass emails to irrelevant journalists
- Promotional fluff disguised as news

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Sending promotional content**: Press releases should inform, not sell
❌ **Ignoring timing**: Some news is time-sensitive
❌ **Poor targeting**: Sending to wrong journalists wastes everyone's time
❌ **Weak headlines**: First thing journalists see, make it count
❌ **Missing contact info**: If they can't reach you, no coverage
❌ **Following up too aggressively**: Professional persistence, not spam
❌ **Neglecting format**: Journalists expect standard formatting

---

## A Few Important Notes

**About AI-generated press releases:**
- Always review and personalize the output
- Verify all facts and figures before sending
- Ensure quotes sound authentic to your spokespeople
- The prompt provides structure, not the news value itself

**About media coverage:**
- No prompt guarantees coverage (that depends on your news)
- Quality journalism relationships still matter
- Timing and relevance are crucial factors
- This tool improves your chances, doesn't guarantee results

**Privacy reminder:**
- Don't paste confidential company information into public AI tools
- Use generic examples if discussing sensitive announcements

1o92ywe,My Thoughts on Meta's Andromeda (And How To Succeed),"Alright y’all, I’ve been seeing a million posts on Reddit talking about Andromeda, how Meta has destroyed ad campaigns, and people speaking of their budgets getting royally f&amp;%ked.

After spending the past few weeks rebuilding \~$2M/mo in ad account spend, and since Andromeda has been hitting my campaigns at different times (seems to have been slowly released and hit more/less aggressively by industry and spend amount) – I had to look at this in first principles. So I dove way too deep into Meta’s engineering blog and then spoke with a few, far more impressive Meta ads peeps I’m friendly with. Then I even chatted with someone high up at Meta and got the inside scoop.

Here’s my honest take on what’s going on with Facebook Ads right now.

More importantly, I think it’s important to look forward on the ‘who, what, and why’ before we all panic.

\#1 | **You’re not crazy and Zuck doesn’t really care about ads**

You didn’t see a drop off because of your pixel. It wasn’t iOS. It wasn’t your ad creatives being improperly sized or your CTA or anything else.

It was **Meta quietly changing their algorithm without explicitly telling anyone.** I don’t particularly respect this, as Zuck has no problem going on podcasts to discuss their Glasses which have like 10k customers. But for the ad engine that accounts for 20-30% of global ad spend, they drop a quiet blog. Shame Zuck, shame.

I’ve long since suspected Zuck really doesn’t give a shit about ads. I genuinely believe Zuck makes it nearly impossible to spend your money unless you're an extremely large account (and thus has an account executive). But then I'll see people who are already spending many millions on Meta and ***still*** don't have any kind of AE. It seems like the barrier to have a dedicated Meta AE is like tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in spend. Shockingly, I don't understand why!  
  
For example, I've had multiple clients who are ready and willing to spend tens of thousands of dollars a month, but for whatever reason, it's impossible to get their account restricted. It's almost always for the most unnecessary and useless account restrictions. I am ready and willing to spend money on your platform, and yet the entire customer support staff is like 3 women in the Phillippines.

**#2 | Zuck understands there are 4 stakeholders in the Meta advertising customer journey:**

 Creative/Creators &gt; Marketer &gt; CTA/Landing Page &gt; Customer

Zuck’s job is in matching core customer characteristics (behavior, readiness to buy, income, misc dopamine factors). This is 10x harder than Google, which can essentially force a bottom of funnel sale. Zuck needs to ensure the ad is good enough to convince you to leave your (already hyper addictive) IG page.

That’s a tough problem to crack!

Also, Zuck has realized a lot of the marketing spend is based around people who are not very impressive - clearly not as impressive as his elite team of ML and AI researchers – and they have old held beliefs. Theoretically, his team should be able to direct ad spend better than someone who doesn’t have a deep look inside the algorithm, daily (and a PhD from MIT).

And that is sorta true…I've taken over massive campaigns where the underlying belief in certain ad creatives was something I never heard of but was considered gospel by the previous account holder.

 Which brings me to my next point...

 **#3 | Zuck doesn’t trust you to spend his money correctly and doesn’t want to be the scapegoat.**

 (Technically, this isn't directly Zuck's money). But spending money on Meta is either justifiable and worthwhile OR not. If the marketing guru spending $100k/mo of a clients's budget and the results are poor – who is to blame? The guru (who works directly with the client) or Meta.

Zuck doesn't wanna be the scapegoat!

It's extremely important that the person running the ads cannot possibly blame Meta for their failure. After all, you are fighting for billions of ad spend – do you really want to trust someone random? F%ck no!

 **#4 | Zuck decided to build the self-driving car for ads.**

There is this debate in self-driving car circles that says at a certain point, if self-driven cars reduce car deaths by even one person, we should all theoretically move over to self-driving cars. It's actually pretty hard to argue that if the goal of a car is ultimately to ensure a smooth drive from point A to point B. And sure, you may enjoy the ride, the freedom, and the slightly more risky driving that you do. But if you have lost a person to an auto accident, you'd know how much you'd give up that feeling. Zuck is most assuredly familiar with this trolley-like problem and realizes he's driving down the highway with a bunch of crazy dudes speeding 100mph and swerving. Does he really want that to affect his annual revenue? Now he could he install a bunch of speed bumps and breathalyzers in the car OR just force you to take the Waymo every day.

And for Zuck, the difference in death is losses to him of hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars every year for no reason other than poor marketing management.

**#5 | The rise of AI creatives and how to Win with Andromeda.**

Let’s go back to this Customer journey:

Creative/Creators &gt; Marketer &gt; CTA/Landing Page &gt; Customer

In the past, marketers and creatives/creators were somewhat divorced. But with the rise of Midjourney, then VEO, Nano Bananas, and now Sora – Creatives are virtually free. 

Content is so cheap and so good, that the only reason to not have 100s of creatives is either laziness or belief that you need less. Zuck is ready to change that.

So Andromeda, and the 3 other changes – really do put content and creativity at the forefront. As soon as I 5x’d my creatives, we started to see significant improvement on ROAS. I then continued to increase creatives until I found a diminishing return (probably about 75-125 creatives but around 40 is a good sweet spot to manage). I also went back into my marketing textbooks and reviewed all forms of ‘reasons to buy’ – trying to build campaigns around trigger points. I don’t believe Meta wants to cut out marketers completely. But it’s more like a Waymo, you give them the destination and they take the wheel for you. Except in this instance, Waymo will drive (test) hundreds of routes for you first and then pick which is the fastest route.

Embrace the changes, embrace the AI slop, get extremely up to date with AI video and image generators, and godspeed.

1ns0gim,Does human written content outperform AI generated content?,"In my experience, the content that I have written without the help of AI ranks higher on Google and is used more as a source in Google’s AI Overview and ChatGPT. 

This is not a 1:1 comparison as I have not tested the same topics written by both myself and AI.

I hypothesize there are couple of reasons for this: 

1.  Google/ChatGPT likely has a way to flag AI content and doesn’t want to train their AI with another AI model. 

2. AI generated content is (usually) unoriginal which leads to it ranking the original source above the AI generated regurgitation. 

What do you think? Have you had success with content written by AI? If so, how did you structure your prompt?

1nrd8u3,FINALLY: ChatGPT ads are coming,"**It's happening. OpenAI just posted a job for a Growth Paid Marketing Platform Engineer.**

The description? Building the infrastructure for paid marketing campaigns, integrations with major ad platforms, and real-time attribution pipelines. Translation: **ads inside ChatGPT are no longer “if”, they’re “when.”**

Why this is big:

* ChatGPT is becoming more and more intent-driven. That's Google’s territory. If ads roll out here, it could be the first real threat to search ad dominance in 20 years. And to be honest, as a Google Ads PPC expert, that would be more than welcome after years of increasing CPCs/CPAs and worsening lead quality (not only on Google, but still).
* The formats are still a mystery. Native “thought leadership” style (like LinkedIn)? Or classic interruptive formats? Both would most likely change how we run campaigns.
* Trust is the elephant in the room. How do you keep users confident if generative answers start blending with sponsored content? This is a big unknown ultimately shaping everything.

OpenAI's head of ChatGPT has already said before that they won’t rule out ads, but they need to be “thoughtful and tasteful.”

1nhiafz,"Disguised promotion on Reddit, for the sake of GEO, has to stop","It’s obvious that there’s an influx of Reddit users passively promoting their own products or services on posts and comments and honestly it’s embarrassing!

I suspect that this is because there’s this narrative that generative search engines and LLMs most frequently cite UGC from the likes of Reddit and Quora.

Let me be clear, the reason these platforms are cited most frequently is simply due to the sheer quantity of related content on these platforms. AI goes NOT prioritise the content on these platforms. If part of your marketing strategy includes writing promotional content thinly veiled behind some shitpost, please for the love of god, cease and desist.

We need to return to generating meaningful content which is aligned with a users behaviour at each stage of the buyer journey, not trying to “hack” some LLMs algorithm. Yes, AI overviews and LLM responses do aggregate content in their responses, so diversify your channels by leveraging earned media, your own social channels, guest writing, YouTube, podcasts AND your own website.

Not only will writing these horrendous posts clearly promoting your product/company do very little if anything for your SEO/GEO, but it’s actively lowering your brand credibility. Trust me when I say, we can all see right through it.

1lv5pzm,Is this toxic environment normal -- how to deal with burnout,"I am a global head of marketing at a SaaS company with about 40 customers, $15M ARR. We have 40 employees. The marketing team is just me and two designers. I also help to run community and am reporting into the community lead, who is also a partner. We are private and self-funded.

After letting go of our VP due to high spending and nominal results, they promoted me and told me they would hire at least someone else to help me. They have not hired anyone. One of my lead designers then went on maternity leave and they did not give me a replacement. 

I am currently responsible for 5 in-person events per year, including our 80+ attendee customer conference, client advisory board, 8-10 virtual events a quarter including all content development, outreach and research for event attendance, demand generation, product marketing, social, and website maintenance. I am also the Salesforce administrator, need to do the budgeting for events, handle any issues with HubSpot, and run all of the reporting with no operations help (RevOps lead just left last year and they are not replacing her either). 

I have zero budget aside from 15k/event that is wholly spent on team T&amp;E and food, and I also cannot hire any contractors.

The leadership team also comes up with new campaigns and initiatives every week and then does not care about the previous ones when they were not finished. They say to drop everything and execute X thing. Then a couple of weeks later I am being asked what happened to the first thing. They do not recollect the conversations they had with me. They also do not think operations or any kind of deck/design work takes time - it is ""table stakes"" and we should be doing that + 40 hours on whatever else.

I've somehow managed to stay above water for the last 1.5 years to the detriment of my personal relationships and health. I'm finally burning out. I mentioned it to the partner and they do not care - instead they told me others were being vocally negative about my absence even if it was due to sickness. I explained that unfortunately the burn out is worse when we have these massive deadlines and I'm working longer hours, sometimes starting at 4 or 5 a.m. Then I get sick afterwards. I have taken 10 sick days so far this year.

She did not ask how I was doing or anything and instead reiterated they are not going to give me any more resources.

I feel like I am so stuck because in order to do my job, I need to be waking up 6 a.m. and working until 4-5 p.m. and by Friday I am wiped and cam barely do anything. I am miserable on Sunday too thinking about work. I want to apply to new jobs, but I am so drained I can barely function. Today she told me that someone said I looked hungover during a webinar too, probably because I am having nightmares about work and barely sleeping. I am in therapy ongoing, and my therapist recommends I leave ASAP and also focus on my health by working out, sleeping, eating healthy, etc. Unfortunately I try for a few days to do that, my work output suffers, and I'm back to not being able to actually do anything to improve my health.

The problem is, I cannot afford to just quit. My house was destroyed last year in a natural dusaster and I have to pay off a reconstruction loan by May 2026. After that, I could probably get by on like half of my current income as my partner is about to get a promotion.

Does anyone have ideas as to balance the burn out with the demands at work right now?

1lke5rh,"My co workers keep re-writing my email copy without telling me they are going to do it. They don't do this for any other marketer, just me. How do I get them to stop and actually respect me?","Just started a new position at a company doing event marketing. Primarily I am to create email invitations for events and do follow up nurture campaigns. 

I work across different industries based out of the US, Europe, India, and Australia.

The process is supposed to do the following

1) I get a campaign brief of the event. 

2) I create the pre-event copy for invitations - the field marketer reviews the copy and asks for edits/tweaks. I then make them and the process is approved and set up to do sending. 

3) I create the post-event copy showcasing the event, providing related content, asking if they would like a demo, and putting the rest into a post event nurture depending on what content they interacted with. - the field marketer reviews and asks for edits/tweaks. I then make them and the process is approved and set up to do sending after the event.

4) I monitor the campaign and look at the data after the campaign finishes for areas of improvement and adjust for future events. 

  
This has been the process for every single marketing campaign I have ever done, regardless of if it is email, ads, phone calls, etc. 



However, in my new role instead of doing this this is what has happened.

1) I get the campaign brief of the event. 

2) I create the pre-event copy. - They review and ask for specific edits. I make those edits, they then instead of using my copy just go ahead and create their OWN copy and use it instead. They do this without telling me, leaving me waiting for approval to set up the send but they never give it to me until what they made is already sent out. 

This is done despite the fact that:

* They don't have demand generation experience
* They don't understand length of emails matter, and send everything as a big blocky text
* They don't understand the importance of certain words in order to optimize open rates
* They don't understand the concepts of Sense of Urgency, Fear of Loss, etc.
* They asked me to rewrite them instead of simply saying they will do it themselves, wasting my time
* I am the one designated as doing the emails based on my job title and description

Additionally, despite me asking several times for an update they instead IGNORE me, but they will still answer OTHER marketers requests related to ads, landing pages, etc. for the event, all in the same email thread that I am on. 

This then sets us BEHIND Schedule. 

  
I'm just up the wall with this on why am I even asked to do this if my expertise is just going to be ignored and my time is wasted? This is especially frustrating because they don't do it with other marketers on the team (They don't re-write any ad copy themselves, they don't rewrite and landing page copy, etc. just my email copy). 

  
Is there anything I can do to get them to actually respect the process, what I do, and just let me do my job instead of wasting my time/ignoring me completely?

1lkb2j2,"So much of marketing is testing. So why are we being punished instead of being allowed to examine, learn, and adjust?","So this might just be me, but I feel like over the last couple of years that in new marketing roles you aren't allowed to come up short of expectations at any point before companies try to scrutinize you/get rid of you. This is especially true for newer initiatives, which any marketer will know that your first couple of campaigns will be lower if it's a brand new concept and you have to see what works.

Example:   
  
In my last role I was brought on at an agency and was told there would be multiple clients to work with, but what ended up happening was they put me on one client where it was for events. I have done event promotion and follow up but I never did any of the ordering of supplies, tracking of shipments, etc. Additionally, I was used to talking to clients directly so I can ask directly what they need but for this role I was talking to the main account rep who would relay to me what they needed. 

Basically, I did one event and the tracking of shipments wasn't what they wanted. But instead of allowing me to examine areas I could improve on and provide adequate training to improve for future events they instead just let me go after 3 months. 

\-------------------

Now in my current role I just started at a place where I am doing post event nurture campaigns, something they have never done before.   
  
I have seen success at a previous position that had lower budgets, but quick response times and more accurate data because it was a smaller company, so I could just do everything myself.   
  
Basically, for the old position since I had more control I could reach out to contacts after a webinar/tradeshow right away. At my new position though, it's highly content on how quickly we get the data back of attendees and how quickly other people can get things set up on there end (I no longer am doing everything to control the funnel, I have to delegate to others). 

  
Because of this, there is a BIG delay on when we can send follow ups, where sometimes we can't send out a first email until 2-3 weeks after they attend (vs my previous gig where it could be done almost next day if we really wanted to).

  
Because of this, I am having to re-learn and test a lot of processes that would have worked previously but aren't as effective currently based on what I'm seeing.

So naturally, what you would do is look at the data of what you're given, look for things you can adjust/test, and then make changes to improve campaigns going forward to get your numbers up to expectations. 

However, I am already getting snippy remarks from people saying things like ""This campaign ONLY generated x signups"" and people are taking the copy I created, disregarding it, and writing it themselves, even though they have never done any kind of post event nurture. 

  
For any other non marketing role, especially a new initiative, I feel like people will understand that you can have experience but still have to learn the companies processes / limitations and your given ample time to do so and nobody acts like they can do your job.

  
However, I am finding it happen more and more for both myself and other marketing people that companies aren't giving you that luxury.

  
TLDR: Do you feel like marketing positions aren't given the same amount of time / respect as others to learn company processes on the job and improve?

But my higher-up is very interested in realistic video generation &amp; other things using the likeliness of the client for their marketing. I know these things are growing in popularity but for small businesses? It also looks uncanny and creepy imo. I just feel like it’s going to turn people off, both end-customer end AND client end. I click away from AI almost immediately but maybe that’s bc I can spot it. 

I’ve tried gently saying this is a bad idea but they like it. So do any of y’all work with tools like this? Is it even feasible with a regular budget rn to get realistic AI video weekly? I personally think it’s ideal to keep it more real &amp; authentic where we’re able to.

1licys1,Is this a legit service?,"I got this email, and I want to know if it’s legit. This person is proposing a 3% sales commission and this is what they said (they’re based in Nigeria): 

Imagine increasing your store’s visibility, traffic, and conversions without paying a single dollar upfront.

I’m proposing a commission-based collaboration: I help bring more buyers to your store and grow your sales, and I only earn when you do. This isn’t about running ads and hoping for results. It’s about building lasting visibility and sustainable growth, based on how your store appears, performs, and is found by shoppers who are already looking for what you sell.

Here’s the proposed strategy: (Products, Offering, Enhancement); 

1. Product

Your product pages aren’t just listings, they’re digital salespeople. If they’re not optimized for how people search, scan, or decide to buy, you’re leaving money on the table.

What I’ll do:

- Rewrite product titles and descriptions to match how real customers search online
- Improve image alt-text, internal linking, and content structure
- Add strategic keywords naturally into product pages and collections
- Make key info easily scannable and persuasive

📌 Goal: Turn product pages into discovery magnets that rank higher and convert better.

2. Offering

Your store’s reputation online matters. When trusted sources mention or link to your site. Google, and your customers start trusting you more.

What I’ll do:

- I'll get your products featured or linked on relevant blogs, product directories, and shopping guides.
- Generate natural backlinks through content collaborations and product reviews
- Create social and third-party presence that reinforces your brand’s value

📌 Goal: Boost your store’s visibility and credibility across the web even outside your own site.

3. Enhancement

Even if your store looks great, if it's slow, confusing, or hard to navigate, visitors bounce. Behind-the-scenes improvements make sure everything loads fast, functions smooth, and ranks strong.

What I’ll do:

- Improve site speed, mobile responsiveness, and core web vitals
- Fix broken links, duplicate content, or messy redirects
- Submit updated sitemaps and make backend tweaks that improve how Google reads your store

Ensure your content structure helps both users and search engines navigate clearly.

📌 Goal: Make sure your store runs clean, fast, and is fully optimized for maximum visibility and usability.

NOTE: All requirements and tools will be provided by you, that's the only role you play as the store owner, I'll do the workings to drive results.

Feel free to ask any questions, or concerns you might want me to address. Would you be interested to proceed with this collaborative idea?

1lh5c8k,Disney v. Midjourney lawsuit,"From what I know, this is the first and the most significant lawsuit currently filed against a generative AI company. Possibly to no one's surprise, Disney is claiming that Midjourney, like a 'real-life vending machine', is churning out unlicensed content. 

Not a law professional, but I did have my fair share of law courses as a marketing student, but to me, it means that, depending on the outcome of the lawsuit, creatives may finally get their chance to get back at generative AI.

1lg39ao,Original content flagged for AI,"Another AI mini-rant incoming.   
  
I'm not denying it – AI tools helped increase efficiencies across processes in many ways. I get that. But I still believe in using AI in a ""lean"" way, especially in content writing. I crave the nuanced, flawed language that can only come from original human thought. But it's gotten to the point now where even THAT can be flagged for AI content. We are essentially being plagiarized by bots. That's what's happening. Our patterns of speech, the little quirks and idiosyncrasies, even those are being taken and used to train these bots. 

I wrote something 100% original the other day, with zero AI help — just classic, old-school Google research. I ran it through an AI detection tool, and it came back to me with ""55% likely to be AI-generated"". 

Then again, you can also argue that AI detection tools should not be taken as seriously as they are. They're faulty and inconsistent, and will flag content from 5-10 years ago as ""likely to be AI-generated."" And why wouldn't they? This is the data that their LLMs were trained on.

Which loops me back to my main point – that we are, to some degree, being plagiarized by language models to generate content, but we're being made to look like *we're* the ones using *their* content. It's a chicken and an egg situation, except we clearly came first.

1lfz6et,Struggling with brand YouTube channel growth after early success. Anyone else?,"When I joined my current company, our YouTube brand account was in rough shape - no thumbnails, weak titles, no descriptions, and multiple versions of the same videos in different languages all dumped into a single channel. We manufacture electronic devices for home and commercial use - not really consumer-level gadgets, but more complex systems that require technical expertise to install. That means end-users rarely buy our products directly, but once they’re installed, they stick around for years.

To bring order and improve discoverability, I split the main channel into separate language-specific ones. That move paid off at the time - we saw a huge spike in subscriptions and engagement, especially from regional audiences.

Fast forward three years, and the momentum has clearly dropped. One factor might be the long content gap (we haven’t published anything in over a year, largely due to my maternity leave), but I also wonder if the decline is deeper than that. Has our content become less relevant, or is this part of a broader shift in how people engage with brand channels - especially in more technical, B2B-style industries?

Another factor might be that our content now feels outdated and overly conservative compared to current video trends. Unfortunately, there’s limited room to change that. Our content still follows a very safe formula: Memphis-style animations and AI-generated voiceovers over real people. Attempts to push for more dynamic or trend-aware formats haven’t gained approval from above.

Side note: I must admit I’m not a YouTube pro - I mostly rely on observing what works on better-performing channels and applying that where I can. We’ve recently started experimenting with Shorts, but so far, it hasn’t had much of an impact. We don't really join any RTM trends as it either takes too long for the content team to produce, or our Head of Marketing does not feel it is appropriate.

We did start publishing Shorts, but I don't see it making an impact on our overall performance.

1l8r2k2,I feel like i'm severely underpaid as a social media manager but I'm not sure (honest responses are appreciated!!),"Hi everyone!! So I've been working as a ""social media manager"" for a small business in NYC for almost 2 years now. Here are the tasks I do:

1. Create social media posts from scratch (from content ideas, to content copy, graphics, caption)

\-They're mostly carousels and I create 5-7 a week!

2) I track daily analytics (email, social media accounts)

3) I create and update landing pages from sales page to all other needed landing pages (design and copy! both from scratch too!)

4)I create PDF guides (freebies) for lean generation

5) I create webinar slides

6) I also optimize and help build the entire business' marketing funnel from generating leads to converting them

7) I also occasionally write email campaigns

8) When we have live launches, I also make sure the automations work

The company I work for is a service-based business that gets clients everymonth at $3,600 each (we get 6-8 clients each month).

In the past almost 2 YEARS of working for the company, the revenue increased by 70%. Their instagram grew from 12k to 33k. Landing page conversion rate is also at 45% (above industry standard), and recently, our live launch got the company 600 registrants which are all from the instagram posts I created.

I do all of this for $550 a week. I feel like I'm really underpaid but I also want to make sure this isn't just my ego. So PLEASE, to anyone with experience as a social media manager, AM I UNDERPAID??

1l7m4t5,How do I tell my client his business is failing for reasons he nor I can control?,"One of my clients is a private practice in the women’s health space offering a procedure that is very costly ($6500). To keep anonymity, I can’t share much more detail than that because people will find the business. 

The problem is NOT that women don’t want the procedure. Overwhelmingly they want it. 

Since 16 months ago when he became a client of mine, I have grown a social media presence from virtually nothing to over 65k TikTok followers with lots of viral videos (a few over a million views, 20ish videos 500k-1m, vast majority between 20-150k views)
I have ran social media ads on Facebook generating good leads of our target demographic for only $12-17 a lead. He has grown 20x in the number of forms and interested women wanting the procedure. I have ran way better radio ads which resulted in a direct increase of forms and consultations.

The problem is, he gets hundreds of forms per month, and only does about 10-15 procedures. He wants to get to 20-25 a month. The ONLY reason why women are declining the procedure, is the out of pocket cost. (We’ve polled them). For certain insurances companies (1.5-2.5% of market share) they cover the procedure entirely which is about $6500-6700. However, over 50% of women have government insurance, 30% have the major three health insurance companies, and the rest of women (a fraction) have other minor insurance companies and very few have the “correct” insurance. 

Our leads and forms data show that 1-2% have the “good” insurance which almost exactly maps onto the market share data.

My solution was, cast a wider net, broaden the funnel, and specifically mention the good insurance companies and retarget women who engaged with the ads telling them about the insurance offer of zero out of pocket. Also, trying to target higher income earners. Done through organic and paid advertising. 

These efforts have resulted in a huge increase of forms, but the problem still remains, nobody has that kind of money even for a truly life changing procedure, and the tiny fraction of insured women with the correct insurance, within the exact demographic of 40-48, and with the symptoms this procedure helps with are extremely hard to find. Think, a few thousand in 10 million total people. 

The ads and organic socials/seo have increased his number of patients, but only patients who earn 250k or more a year or have the exact right insurance policy. And still, not past the 20 procedures a month. We’re talking 4-5 people who fit the exact perfect conditions. 

Think, a list of 500 Facebook leads with handwritten boxes, good contact info, get on the phone and seem excited about it, only for 1-2 people to get the procedure. 

He is convinced that if we can just tell people about it, they will come running. But we have literally told tens of millions of women about it who have engaged with our content, and thousands have signed up for consultations and met with him, but ultimately decline because it’s out of their budget. 

How do I tell him there isn’t a database of peoples private insurance policy that we can get and run ads on them… and most importantly, am I doing something wrong or is this just a bad business?

1l2hlaw,Meta AI ads… should we be worried ?,"So there’s talk (and some internal reports) that Meta is planning to roll out a full-on AI ad system by 2026. Think ChatGPT meets a marketing agency — but it’s trained specifically to generate, test, and optimize ads automatically across Meta platforms.

Basically, you’d tell it your product and budget, and Meta’s AI would do everything:
Write and design ads
Target the audience
Adjust bids in real time
Analyze performance and tweak strategy without human input

What happens to the thousands of marketing agencies and freelancers out there whose bread and butter is Meta ads?
Do they pivot to just managing the AI tools? Focus on brand-building and strategy outside Meta’s ecosystem? Or do a lot of jobs just disappear?

Also, would you trust Meta’s AI to market your brand -especially when they control both the ad delivery and the optimization logic?

I understand that SEO will go in the backend, where AI would fetch data from. But then again it may not quote our company unless asked to cite sources specifically. So how do we market ourselves?

1kyqlv5,Whats expectation for a Performance Marketing role?,"Its been almost a month since I was hired as a Performance Marketer. I used to be a Digital Media Buyer/Campaign Manager and handle all things paid ads (planning/strat, forecasting rates, implementation, monitoring, reporting) for over 6 years. 

Now as I’ve said, its been almost a month and I haven’t touched a single meta or googles ad campaign. The role is heavy on creating new creative briefs for ads. And its not just generating ideas, i actually have to do the copywriting for it which i dont really have experience with and im getting a lot of revisions cause our team lead is very specific but they’re aware that i dont have a background in it. Our pod is set up like this:

1 Account Manager - team lead

2 performance marketers - us

1 Creative - graphic artists/translates our ideas to actual creatives.

Now i just wanna how heavily involved should a performance marketer be in terms of creatives. During the interview i initially thought that I was just gonna come up with content ideas and/or identify the best performing creatives so we can replicate it and the creative person would be the one to actually write it/make it. 

Im just having a lot of frustrations cause im not doing good with the role so far because of this and i havent been able to do what i know im good at (which is why i thought i was hired.) 

our team lead, AM runs the show in our pod and during my first week i initially thought that she would be the one to do all these content ideas along with the creative person but i feel like she passes everything to PM. And i feel like im an AM/PM/Creative in this role. Just need some clarity as im struggling with my expectations. Im not enjoying what im doing so far and I just wanna be able to handle campaigns and not just write copies and make briefs. 

I took a peek at the job description i applied for and there isnt one thing stated there that i have to do a bunch of creatives.

1ks99vd,Close to giving up,"Hi

Pre warning: this is going to be a rambly post.

I'm in b2b marketing. For 8 years (my whole career, I'm 27) I've done it all

- brand management
- ABM
- customer marketing
- social
- market research
- paid (search and linkedin)
- content marketing (you name it)
- outbound
- every type of events and webinars
- partner marketing
- graphic design
- website management
- CRM (HubSpot and Salesforce)
- reporting (lead gen, conversion, revenue)
- affiliate and referral management

But honestly? There's not one thing in my career that I can point to as a big highlight.

I've run events that have driven deals - but not many. I've made content thats generated leads - but not a lot.

I've just finished a trade show which I spent 3 months working my butt off for - and it's looking like we're going to miss our lead gen target by a long shot. Our other activities aren't performing to scratch either.

I'm just so tired of trying to be the best at everything - and I'm at a point where I don't have enough love for any of the things I've done to specialise. Sick of being told to focus on one thing at a time - but it never happens in practice because I'm always responsible for everything.

I've always been b2b tech - but across 3 very different audiences over my 8 years, and I've never felt like a real expert in any space, so I can't really lean on that either.

I've switched jobs 3 times in 3 years - I can't see switching again being good for my CV. 

I don't even know what advice I'm looking for, here - I'm just so tired of reporting on missed targets. Guess I'm just posting to see if anyone feels / has overcome similar?

1kq8o6s,Have you adjusted your content strategy based on TikTok’s new keyword ranking data?,"I noticed a few interesting feature updates this week across platforms, but the one that really caught my attention was TikTok rolling out keyword ranking insights for videos.

As someone working in social media strategy, this feels like a potential shift in how we think about TikTok SEO. If creators can see how their videos perform for specific search terms, that could seriously impact how we approach hooks, captions, or even niche targeting. It also makes me wonder how this might influence discoverability strategies moving forward.

Has anyone seen this feature in their account yet? Have you changed anything in your content plan based on it?

Also saw smaller updates like:

– Reels auto-posting now available via Meta Business Suite

– YouTube Shorts adding link stickers

– X testing pinned replies

– IG experimenting with AI-generated captions

1kmmpqh,"AI search engines absolutely suck at citations, says CJR report","Yeah!!! I call this a sign of relief because day by day, it felt like we were heading toward AI doomsday.

*Long post alert.*

The report by the Columbia Journalism Review on AI search tools is crazy.

They compared 8 AI search engines, and all of them are terrible at citing news.

But...

This isn’t just a journalism problem. It’s a marketing problem too. Because these AI tools don’t actually find information, they just repackage it, often without fact-checking the original sources.

Which means:

— Less traffic to publishers
— More incorrect or misleading answers
— Fabricated links to non-existent articles (happens way too often even with the reasoning feature turned on)

And that's not even the worst part. AI tools often *confidently* give wrong answers.

This reminds me of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent AI Summit speech, where he pointed out how AI tools can’t generate an image of someone writing with their left hand. People tested it, but the tools kept defaulting to the right, even when corrected.

Are premium models doing any better??? 

According to the report, not really. They’re just charging users for more polished misinformation.

And this isn't just a ChatGPT problem. Every major generative search tool tested had the same issues:

— Struggled to retrieve accurate news
— Ignored publisher blocks on web crawling
— Cited syndicated copies instead of original sources

AI search isn't just breaking how we find news or content. It’s distorting it.

We cannot let AI handle verification alone. I’m honestly hesitant to fully trust Perplexity, ChatGPT, or DeepSeek anymore.

AI is NOT replacing human expertise anytime soon, not until we have flawless AI-powered search tools with transparency, accurate citations, and real-time verification.

And even then, it’ll still need a human to oversee it.

This honestly feels like a wake-up call.

I was already getting sick of all the “AI-powered” branding hype anyway.

All AI and no human touch makes Jack a dull boy.",Siddhesh900,marketing,1747247500.0,23,23,13,https://reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1kmmpqh/ai_search_engines_absolutely_suck_at_citations/,https://reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1kmmpqh/ai_search_engines_absolutely_suck_at_citations/,False,News,False,2025-11-26T05:24:19.167673+00:00
1kmh8yb,State of The Marketing-Mix 2025 - Where do new companies start today?,"Marketing and Growth are the lifeblood of any successful business.

You can build the best product, partner with the best vendor, offer the best service &amp; best prices. Doesnt matter.  If no one knows you exist, or tests your business, you will not make any money.

Period.

The hard truth?

You must take care of marketing, one way or another.

But also marketing changes, and it changes fast.

What used to work 2 years ago, barely moves the needle today.

If you are not in the tranches, and if you are not constantly testing, experimenting,  breaking things, and experiencing the different channels on your own, you are guessing.

And guessing gets expensive.

Ive watched founders burn tens or hundreds of thousands on agencies, hires, paid ads and ""growth hacks"" all based on guess work or some playbook which is a couple years old, or in marketing terms - ""antique"".

Ive been hands-on in the game since keyword stuffing, PBNs and media buying on random websites actually delivered results. And as a fractional CMO for early-stage businesses I am still hands on, so I will share with you what works, and most importantly what absolutely doesnt, no matter what you read in an outdated blog post or saw on TikTok / Youtube.

Lets start with the big dog.

The one marketing channel everyone wants to have because it drives free sales, 0 CAC, LTV:CAC = Infinite.

**SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION**

If we are talking standard SEO = Google Optimization?

Its dead... the funeral happened long ago.

It died the slow death of a thousand cuts of revenue optimization, new formats emerging, shifting content consumption habits, and, of course Googles hunger for more money.

With the emergence of AI as search tools, the market share of Google is dropping, and in the next couple years it will become a secondary search channel.

Google stole the market from Yahoo and Lycos by delivering no-bullshit, intent-matched results.

Straight to the point.

And now.. its 60% fluff, 40% you trying to find what you actually searched for.

No wonder its so much easier just to ask ChatGPT when you have questions and hope that it doesnt halucinate.

Since this section would mean nothing without numbers, here are some:

here’s a current snapshot of organic CTRs for Google Search under 3 different conditions:.

|SERP|Classical Search Page (Ads incl)|Search with rich-content|search with AI overview|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|27.6%|22%-25%|10%|
|2|15.8%|16%-18%|7%|
|3|11%|12%|5%|
|4|8.4%|9%|4%|
|5|6.3%|6%|3%|

**Sources** (cant post links, but you can google it... no pun intended):

* *We Are TG - Google CTR by Position (2025)*
* *Milestone Research – State of the SERPs: Rich Result Impact (2024)*
* *Search Engine Journal – Impact of AI Overviews on Google CTR (2025)*
* *WordStream – Google Ads Benchmarks (2024)*

**The question is:** What does all of this mean for you as a company founder / owner / entrepreneur?

Money keywords are heavily contested in all industries, every one of your competitors will fight for them.

You wont rank top 5 unless your website has serious authority.

And that means you will burn time and cash on content, distribution, digital PR, technical SEO.

If you are on a short runway?

You dont have the luxury. You can not afford to go all-in.

The only use-cases in which SEO can work for you are branded searches, and niche specific solution-focused queries tied directly to the pain you solve ""right now"".

Bonus points if that pain point is your differentiator in a competitive market.

So the next time someone starts tooting the horn for SEO for Startups or early stage companies, check if they are not working for an SEO Agency.

Now to the next usual suspect e for every marketing mix, the so-called heroin where you pump in money in order to get the quick high of a sale

**PERFORMANCE MARKETING**

Performance marketing still works. It depends on the channel and the buyer journey stage.  
Platforms have moved hard over the past couple of years to reduce campaign control and take away any safety net you had.  
Meta is pushing advantage+ audiences and placements to ""help"" you reach the ""right"" people wherever they are (well, it doesnt).  
Google is removing features; ""Audience Segment"" (doesnt work), ""negative keywords"" (barely works), ""exact vs phrase match"" (doesnt work), despite having the options in the dashboard, and pushing towards performance Max campaigns = set, forget, watch your wallet drain.

Twitter is... lets be honest... has anyone ever run a successful acquisition campaign on Twitter?

On the other end of the equation the basic pricing models on the platforms are shifting, CPMs and CPCs are increasing, due to inflation money is worth less and the competition is brutal.

For newly founded companies the budgets you would need to spend for ""assisted"" optimization are unaffordable.

For Meta you need 50 conversions per week for advantage+ to optimize.

Let’s break that down for a new B2C / DTC account with conservative performance:

* **CPM** (US Based Audience) - 30 USD
* **CTR on Ads** \- 1.5% (It can be higher, it can be lower, but lets face it, you will not nail your positioning, your assets or your targeting on the first try so 1.5% is generous)
* **Landing page conversion rate** \- 10%
* **Lead to Sale conversion rate (7d attribution)** \- 30%

In order for Meta to get enough conversion data for the sales conversion (50 sales). You will need the following:

* **111.000** Impressions
* **1667** clicks to website
* **167** leads

That comes out to  **3.300 USD / week**, so an average **CAC** of 66 USD per Meta Sale.

If you do everything at least somewhat right.

The problem with Advantage+ comes from the 2nd Phase.

Advantage+ is shit at optimizing the campaigns, and its useless at increasing relevant reach.

Sources:

* *""Meta Advantage+ in 2025: The Pros, Cons, and What Marketers Need to Know""* *(Marpipe Blog)*
* *""Multiple Reddit posts by distraught advertisers""*

The real story is not as bleak as the intro sounds, you can still make great money with performance marketing.

The trick is not to follow the suggestions the platforms are giving you.

Meta lookalike audiences, custom audiences, placements on Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp are really great.

But you have to pull up your sleeves and do the dirty work yourself.

Meta and Google Ads can help you if you know how to use them as an operator, not as a service user who just wants to have the platform do the work for them.

You need a clear marketing attribution model system in place, offline conversions have to be setup and the conversion API needs to be properly setup to give the systems as much data as possible.

At that stage you have a clear picture where your money is going, who your customers are, and how much you have to spend in order to get a new lead or customer.

Their profit is your investment, it does not matter if you ever get positive ROI as long as you spend your advertising budget.

For early stage performance marketing I would **recommend testing Reddit Ads.**

The big difference to the mainstream performance marketing channels is that the CPM &amp; CPC are a fraction of what you would pay on Meta and Google Ads.

The **interest**, **sub-reddit** and **keywords** based targeting works if you have done your homework and understand your personas, and it can become a great catalyst for traffic and data-points which you can utilize for retargeting through the more expensive channels.

The more touch points you make, the better it is.

The buyer intent of Reddit traffic is low in comparison to other channels, unless you absolutely nail the right positioning, assets and targeting, but the overall CAC is good due to the low media cost.

I have used it in the past couple years with significant success and it is one of my major channels for all projects I work on.

**TikTok** is showing promise as an emerging performance marketing channel, but its still in its infancy.

Here is what I have seen so far:

* Slow support
* Issues with delivery when campaigns are launched from desktop
* Extremely fast Ad fatigue onset

Are just 3 of some of the issues I have experienced with it. But my personal experience with TikTok is not significant enough to give a detailed breakdown on pros and cons.

It is still something worth testing, especially if your buyer persona is Millennial or Gen-Z

Other performance marketing channels, like **Outbrain** for **Apple Search Ads** for Appstore promotion are good for specific use cases, but they will certainly not be your pillar of initial growth.

Test everything. See if it moves the needle. If not, kill it and move on.

**CONTENT MARKETING - SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING**

It is time that every blog lover faces the music.

Written content is dying.

***We want Podcasts with accelerated replay***

***Videos with skippable segments,***

***Memes... just for the, not even ""HaHa"", but sharp exhale and micro-hit of dopamine***

***We consume on the go, we are to****o* ***lazy to read, we don't care about your life story, we want answers to our questions.***

***Even the 3 minute youtube video you posted is to long...***

***ANSWER MY QUESTION!***

That is the average internet user in 2025.

Social media content is not made to educate. Its meant to entertain.

And if you now think: ""*Yeah, but I can engineer a prompt for ChatGPT to create 100 social media posts in an authentic brand voice and schedule these with buffer in the time it takes for my hot pocket to be done in the microwave""...*

You can.

It will fail.

It might not fail to generate visibility.

It might not fail to generate comments.

It will fail your short-term business goals, and will leave you with a slurry of non-identified followers with whom you have zero connection.

It will fail forming your brand voice, and creating something authentic you can build on.

We always go back to the **time = money = runway** equation when building a fresh online business.

Social Media Marketing is strong.

But, it also requires a strong, talented professional to execute.

A charismatic and unique hook and something with a strong recognition value.

**EVERY DAY** Over 400 MILION Photos and Videos are posted online.

**EVERY DAY** Over 650 MILION Tweets are published.

Half-Assed efforts will not stand out in this deluge of content.

Virality is not a strategy, virality is a happy accident, and if you achieve it celebrate it.

For Social Media Marketing to work, your prep work needs to be on point.

Persona research. Content strategy. Channel strategy. Marketing automation. Engagement strategy. Conversion funnel mapping.

All steps need to be in place.

Content IS still King.

The game has just become a bit more complicated than a few years go.

For B2B building a strong presence on **LinkedIn** is a must, it creates a very strong trust signal for prospects in the consideration phase and strongly supports the buying process.

**Brand Authority building** can be accelerated with **TikTok** and **YouTube Shorts** which will lead people to longer form videos, or intrigue them enough to actually read an email you send them... not a blog post though, that one is still a hard sell.

**Twitter** can lead to authentic connections, but beware of falling into a echo chamber trap.

In any case, Content Marketing and Social Media Marketing as a sub-set of it are necessary to even be taken serious in the first place.

Brands without a social media footprint have a hard time building trust.

In a time of **skibidi toilet** I can not with a straight face preach that high quality is necessary.

As seen from **Kanye West** and his iPhone video during the Superbowl

But **authenticity is a must.**

Circling back to the automated content creation bit;

**Khaby Lame** would have never become famous if he didnt find his authentic style... think about it.

1kj98jf,"The opportunity of a life time, what should i do?","How does big corporations create/manage their social media&amp;website accounts and marketing teams?

This question is broken into two parts “security” and “team building”, im looking for feedback for both and an example or experience on how everything was setup for the marketing department in a medium/big company 

-the story behind the question-

I’ve been managing several  small businesses social media/marketing activities successfully  (60 to 200 employees ) but never a this size (over 2000 employees where a hacker targeting the business is more common ) 

in past week a big company in my country working in ceramic B2B tableware (cups, plates..etc) contacted me to create and manage their accounts (the owner is a close friend to the family) he used to use his personal account as the “business account” and he never really cared about social media but he got hacked (he was freelancing everything with some of my tips in the past) and never really cared about social media but unfortunately due to (many people “freelancers” having access to the account and the fact it’s his “personal accounts” he got hacked and lost access 

After weeks of trying i convinced him to consult a well known agency in my country to know what should he do since he wanted to scale in the b2c market, they gave him a list of what they would do but i told him the cost were crazy compared to creating an in-house marketing team so he -I wasn’t really expecting it or trying too- offered me to build the team and became the marketing director possibly a CMO in 2-4 years and manage the B2B business too if everything run smoothly according to the growth plan

My plan after some consultation is like this 
1- contact the network and security department/consultancy and setup a password generator/manger that stores the password on our hosts using (enpass)


2-Get a domain name and use it to create the company email 

3-create (for example meta) a personal account for the founder&amp; or anyone who can claim the business and use it to create a business accounts

Same goes for other social media accounts and google 

•~file to claim and verify ownership

4-setup a social media crm to access the accounts for specific tasks so that the laptops don’t have to save login information
And any attempt to access the accounts would result in sending an email to the c level mangers 

5-for the content team, daily fast and fun content (reels, TikToks…etc) that is usually done by phones and require less Rigorous process they would be granted access to a dummy account to do their research and content creation then they would send it to the moderators

 feels secure but super rigorous, which is really bad in today’s era of marketing (social media marketing specifically)

Is there a simpler way that can achieve a similar level of security or at least close enough one

1kimnh0,No More Prompt Engineering for Content Marketers: How to Brief AI Like a Copywriter,"*In the beginning was the word, and your word was not yours.*

I still see many creators interact with LLMs like they are a smarter search engine. That’s a mistake.

A prompt is not a query, so it should not be formulated like a query. 

A prompt is a brief.

Following Google's release of a detailed [prompt engineering guide](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-prompt-engineering), I want to share a practical breakdown of how to design prompts that give you **(re-)usable, brand-aligned** content—and how to stop getting ""meh"" outputs that need hours of rewriting.

---

## Step 1 – Understand how LLMs [actually](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-prompt-engineering) work

It is painful to see people having used LLMs for years but still fail to understand their inner workings.

After receiving your input (which is treated as a *sequence of tokens*), LLMs **predict the tokens that should come after it**, one by one, based on probability. So when you ask them to write a headline, they’re statistically guessing what *should* come next—based on all the data they’ve been trained on.

Thus, when you submit a prompt to ChatGPT, you do not ""ask"" from it to do something; rather, you *brief to* it the desired output.

Think of the LLM as a **junior writer**.

If you give a vague or unstructured brief, you get generic outputs.

But when you give:

- context  
- voice/tone instructions  
- examples  
- clear formats

...the model starts writing in ways that feel aligned.

---

## Step 2 – Experiment with Battle-Tested Prompt Types

1. **Role prompting** → Helps the model match voice &amp; tone from the start.  
   *Sample*: “You are a senior B2B copywriter. Your tone is skeptical, concise, and dryly witty.”

2. **Few-shot prompting** → Examples *teach the model the pattern* you want it to follow. Give 3 strong examples, then ask it to write one more.

3. **System + context prompting** → Frames your *task* before the model starts generating.  
   *Sample*: “Your task is to write meta descriptions for B2B SaaS tools. Focus on clarity and CTR. Limit to 140 characters.”

4. **Chain-of-Thought prompting** → Break down complex content (like landing pages) into manageable logic steps.  
   *Sample*: “First, list the pain points. Then position the benefit. Then write the CTA.”

---

## Step 3 – Implement Widely-Adopted Best Practices

- Be **directive**, not vague. *“Write a 2-line CTA with urgency for a productivity app.”*

- Use positive instructions over negative constraints. The former *help* the model more accurately understand what it is called to do, without aimlessly pondering on what is permitted.

- Ditch all unnecessary information. If something seems useless or even confusing to you, it is much more so to the model.

- Use **verbs to describe the task at hand**: write, summarize, extract, compare, position, persuade.

- Always **test different prompt structures** (question vs statement vs instruction). Different prompt attributes work better with different models.

- If you're using outputs in automation, ask for **structured formats** (e.g., JSON). This forces the model to create structure and limit hallucinations. It returns always in the same *style*, and focuses on the data you want to receive.

- Document your successful prompts as templates. Update them upon model updates (e.g., GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4).

- Limit the maximum word length.

---

## Step 4 – Steal My Landing Page Content Generator Prompt

### a. System Prompt (Set the Role and Point-of-View)
You are a senior conversion copywriter with experience in SaaS, DTC, and B2B funnels. You follow frameworks like PAS, AIDA, and Jobs-to-be-Done. Your writing is clear, persuasive, and grounded in emotional insight. You avoid fluff, buzzwords, and over-promising.

### b. Context Prompt (Specify the Product, Use-Case, and Audience)
The product is: [Insert 1-line product description].

Its key features include: [List 3–5 features].

The main audience is: [Describe the ICP—who they are, what role they have, what they care about].

The pain points this audience experiences are: [List 2–4 core pains].

The product’s primary differentiator is: [What makes it better/different than alternatives].

The call to action is: [What do you want the reader to do? E.g., sign up, book a demo, start trial].

### c. Format Prompt (Define Structure)
Structure the landing page with the following sections:
- Headline
- Subheadline
- Hero CTA
- Social proof or testimonial (optional)
- Pain + agitation (PAS framework)
- Solution overview
- Feature/Benefit bullets (max 5)
- Visual explainer text (for image or gif)
- Use case highlight
- Secondary CTA
- Objection handling (FAQ format)
- Footer microcopy (1–2 sentence reassurance or compliance)

Write everything in a single draft.
Use short, punchy sentences. Prioritize clarity. Inject emotional resonance when naming pains or benefits.

1kffdjv,How do you reach creators (and their managers) when you’re not asking for promotion?,"We’re a small startup building a tool that helps creators earn more from their content — think of it like turning their recipes or food videos into instantly shoppable, commission-generating posts. The twist? We’re not asking them to promote us. We’re offering them early access to a tool that lets them monetize their own content more effectively.

But here’s the challenge:  
When we reach out, especially to managers, they only see ""commission-based = no guaranteed money"" and stop the conversation there. The creators we *have* talked to directly absolutely love the concept and get excited, but even they default to asking for flat fees — even though we’re not asking them to post about us. It’s like they’re so used to the brand-deal model that it’s hard to reframe what we’re offering.

We believe creators *shouldn’t* promote something they don’t believe in or use. We want them to use the tool to grow *their own* income and audience — not ours. So paying flat fees doesn’t make sense for us or them.

Has anyone here cracked this before? How do you *communicate value* when what you're offering is fundamentally different from a sponsorship? How do you reach creators (especially at the micro/mid-tier) *before* their managers shut it down?

1kb2ffc,Unreliable lawn service. Google writes some killer ads!,"Marketers, a quick heads-up about a frustrating and potentially damaging experience with Google Ads' ""Automatically Created Assets"" (ACA).

Even though we had previously opted out of ACA, it was quietly re-enabled on April 5th. We didn’t realize it until we saw a live ad headline generated by Google that read: “Unprofessional and Unreliable – Unreliable Lawn Service”

This wasn’t a review or user-generated content. This was a paid ad headline Google’s automation wrote for us.

It’s hard to overstate how damaging this could be to a brand. Automation is great when it works, but this crossed a line.

A few takeaways for others:
Double-check your ACA settings, even if you think you’ve opted out.
Keep a close eye on your live ads and previews.
If you’re seeing similar issues, it might be time to bring it up with your Google rep.
Automation should never come at the cost of brand trust. This was a reminder that human oversight is still critical in paid media.

1kagkua,Transitioning from freelancing to remote job (need advice),"I’ve been freelancing for the past 4 years, mostly in content marketing, writing, social media, and lead generation. A while ago, I tried building an agency, but it didn’t work out the way I had hoped. After that experience (and a lot of mental exhaustion), I have finally decided to get a job. 

I’m now actively looking for a fully remote job in a SaaS company, ideally based in the US or UK. 

Why SaaS? Because I’ve worked with technical industries before. Also, I was pursuing Computer Science Engineering before I dropped out when my interests shifted. However, I do have solid technical knowledge, and I believe it could come in handy in SaaS marketing roles if needed.

I am not based in the US/UK. 

Right now, my approach is

* Researching SaaS companies in the US and UK 
* Sending cold emails to HRs/founders
* Following up with LinkedIn connections if no response after a few days



A couple of things I would love your opinion on

* Based on my background, do you think breaking into a remote SaaS marketing role is realistic (considering i don’t have a degree but i don’t think it’s important either?)? 
* Average salaries I’m seeing are around $50–60k, is that realistic for my experience, or should I adjust expectations?
* Is there anything I should be doing differently or keeping in mind to land a role faster? Any tips? Anything particular SaaS companies look for in marketers at this growth stage?



Would love any advice, thoughts, or red flags you think I should be aware of. Thanks a ton for reading!

I’ve spent a decent amount on paid ads — Google, Facebook, etc. The traffic is there. People click. Sometimes they even call. But then...

\- We suck at follow up.

1k4qlk1,"In-house marketers, how many of you work alongside an agency? Am I being replaced?","In-house marketers, is working alongside an agency a common dynamic, or is it usually a sign you're position is on its way to being eliminated?

I have only ever worked in-house. At my last job, they eventually hired an agency to work alongside me. The agency was awful, spit out 100% AI-generated mess, and my new ""job"" was basically to clean up their work. My boss made me redo almost everything they handed to us. My boss always praised my work. Ultimately the only reason for hiring the agency and keeping them around was because we needed a team to code and maintain for us a new website. I eventually left the company for unrelated reasons.

At my new job, things have been going amazing. They've slowly been increasing my responsibilities, which is great because I'm capable of a lot more than the small content workload they've delegated to me. I've received a lot of praise for my work, and I feel like they've been investing in me (upgrading my technology and tools I need for work, etc.)

However, I'm not even four months in, and there's already talk now about onboarding a marketing agency.

Because of my old job experience, I'm used to that symbiotic relationship, but I also find it pretty useless considering I have a broad skillet and can do everything they're asking this agency to do, of course, sans coding them a website.

The company I work for is also in an extremely niche industry, which really benefits from and needs someone like me to be in-house and boots-on-the-ground to understand and market them effectively.

I feel like this is a replay of my old job because, again, the main reason they are supposedly bringing this agency on board is to redo their website. If that's the case, I can't help but wonder, why not just hire a website designer?

I'm also suspicious of being replaced, because they don't talk about this change to me much, even when I directly press them for info about it and express interest and eagerness to be a part of the decision-making process. As their ""Marketing Specialist,"" who's supposedly going to be working alongside this agency, you'd think my company would want me actively involved in this process and familiarizing myself with the new team. But, no.

They talk about this change constantly amongst themselves, in a hushed tone.

I've also picked up in conversation that, well, they didn't even read my resume upon hiring me. Which signals to me that they just took a chance on me because in the moment, they were desperate to fill the role.

So, what gives? Am I right to be suspicious? Should I be looking for a new job? Or is this common practice, and I'm paranoid?

1jkhekc,Do marketers ever generate blog posts by interviewing SMEs at the companies they're producing the content for?,"Let me just start off that I'm not a marketer, abut I have done some SEO work in the past. If my post is not appropriate here, I apologize. It's just always something I've been very curious about.

At the companies I've worked at in the past, I've seen it that they'll have an outside marketing company generate blog posts for them. I know the outside marketing company will run the content by an internal stakeholder (like marketing manager) before running with the post.

Is this typical? I feel like you get ""meh"" level content, but nothing really that interesting. Since it's some copywriter that is just researching on the internet to come up with content.

I've always felt that it would make sense for a copywriter to schedule 30 minutes (or longer) with a one of the subject matter experts (SME) to interview them in order to get information to use for generating blog posts. Like if you're a plastics thermoforming company, interview one of the lead technicians that has been working on it for 30 years. Or if you're a software house, interview one of the more senior coders.

The downside, is that you have an expensive resource (the SME) whose time you're taking up. I feel like the ideal would be to have that SME actually write the blog post themselves, but a lot of people aren't great writers and that would take considerably more time.

The upside to me though would be that you could create thought leaderships blog/content pieces, without a ton of investment. Do companies do this? Or does it not make a lot of sense to do so?",faceerase,marketing,1743010137.0,1,1,1,https://reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1jkhekc/do_marketers_ever_generate_blog_posts_by/,https://reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1jkhekc/do_marketers_ever_generate_blog_posts_by/,False,Discussion,True,2025-11-26T05:24:19.167673+00:00
1jgg503,"SEO/AI buzz: Users who click from SERPs with AI Overviews spend more time on sites, AI-generated content floods search results, and more","Hey guys! Kick off the week with SE Ranking's expert take on the latest SEO trends and AI advancements. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Several hot topics are fueling discussions around AI Overviews. Some SEO experts are challenging Google’s statements** about internal algorithm updates affecting link placement timing. Concerns are also mounting over how Google collects and presents its data in public statements.

Barry Schwartz, citing Digiday’s article, *Publishers Don’t Really Know How Google AI Overviews Is Impacting Their Referral Traffic*, explored these issues in depth on Search Engine Roundtable. He highlighted expert analysis from discussions on X, where industry professionals have been closely tracking these developments.

Experts argue that significant changes to link placements within AI Overviews happened later—around August 2024—rather than in May, as Google previously stated. They also question Google’s claim that users who click through AI Overviews spend more time on websites compared to traditional search results, calling for transparency on the data supporting this assertion.

The most debated quote among SEO professionals:

*""A Google spokesperson said Google has made updates since AI Overviews went live last May to add more links and make it easier for people to click those links and visit sites. Those changes include adding in-line links and a right-hand display on desktop that shows links when  previously they would have appeared at the bottom of the AI Overviews feature. The spokesperson also said people who click from search result pages with AI Overviews spend more time on those sites. Google did not provide data to back this up.""*

With so many unanswered questions, the SEO community is pressing for clarity. Stay tuned as we follow these developments closely!

**Brodie Clark recently discussed critical challenges presented by AI Overviews.** Here are some key takeaways:

1. New AI Overview Features

Google is expanding AI Overviews globally. A new format now appears lower on search results pages, unlike the traditional version at the top (similar to featured snippets).

2. Link Visibility Issues

This new format is open by default but doesn’t display links to the content used, a notable departure from Google’s prior approach.

3. Appearance in Other SERP Features

AI Overview elements are also appearing in *Things to know* and *People also ask* sections, again without direct links, raising visibility concerns for publishers.

4. Tracking Difficulties

Standard SEO tools track top-position AI Overviews, but this new variation remains largely unmonitored, making data collection challenging.

5. Lack of Google Search Console Support

Unlike merchant listings, AI Overviews currently lack dedicated tracking filters in GSC—and Google has suggested this isn’t likely to change.

6. Impact on SEO Strategy

The lack of visibility and tracking options makes it harder for site owners to gauge the impact of AI Overviews. SEO tools must adapt quickly to keep up.

**Kevin Indig analyzed over 7,000 citations across 1,600 URLs to uncover patterns in how AI systems** like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and AI Overviews cite content. His findings, published on Growth Memo, reveal:



* *Traditional SEO metrics don’t strongly influence AI chatbot citations.*
* *Content depth (longer word and sentence counts) and readability (strong Flesch scores) matter more.*
* *Different AI chatbots prioritize different types of content—monitoring multiple platforms is essential.*
* *Brand popularity (measured by search volume) is the strongest predictor of citations, especially in ChatGPT.*
* *Prompt structure affects brand visibility, but the full impact of user phrasing remains unclear.*
* *Technical issues can prevent AI citations—ensure your site isn’t blocking LLM crawlers via robots.txt or CDN settings.*

*The feature is still in testing and has not yet been rolled out to all users.*

* **(test)  Product Quiz for Personalized Recommendations in Search Results**

Another experimental feature from Google prompts users with product-related questions to generate tailored recommendations. The quiz, labeled ""Get Tailored Recommendations,"" adjusts search results based on responses, displaying a personalized carousel of ""top picks for you.""

A new issue has surfaced where Google has replaced restaurant booking systems like OpenTable with Google Assistant, causing significant disruption. 

One restaurant managed by Claudia Tomina experienced this problem, where instead of using the usual OpenTable integration, Google began using Google Assistant to place calls for reservations. However, due to a system flaw, Google Assistant repeatedly called the restaurant without connecting, eventually blocking customers from making any reservations. 

When the restaurant turned off Google Assistant, Google marked them as ‘not accepting reservations,’ causing further frustration. This incident highlights Google’s ongoing challenges in managing third-party booking systems.

1jdhvfg,TLDR: Need help crafting a comprehensive marketing strategy for an enterprise b2b company.,"
Hey everyone, I need some serious B2B marketing wisdom. Apologies for the long post, but I'm facing a tight deadline and a huge learning curve.

I've got two weeks to present a complete marketing strategy for the tech company I joined two months ago. Before this, I spent four years at a marketing agency in Dubai, primarily focused on social media, community management, advertising, and reporting. Think flashy campaigns, trendy taglines, and creating buzz for FMCG products. It was all about engagement and brand hype.

Now, I'm at a SaaS tech company with high-value, enterprise-level services. My initial role was to continue managing social media, focusing on culture, events, and thought leadership. But I've also been tasked with building a comprehensive marketing strategy to generate leads and boost awareness.

Here's the catch: the company relies heavily on inbound leads and wom, and their marketing team is small and lacks structure. They want me to build a marketing funnel targeting specific firmo and geo graphics and 

This is where I'm hitting a wall.
I'm struggling to reconcile the idea of convincing C-suite executives to invest hundreds of thousands (if not millions) through social media posts and blog content. It feels like a disconnect. I'm new to the B2B space and need guidance.

Currently, I'm considering an account-based marketing (ABM) approach, highlighting target companies and building consistent presence across all channels with value-driven content. I'm also thinking about media outreach, event participation, webinars, LinkedIn lead gen forms, and pushing content to the website for consultation scheduling.

Other tactics I'm exploring include LinkedIn invites, targeted LinkedIn ads, SEO for long-term ROI, and email marketing. The sheer scope of this holistic approach is overwhelming. There's no internal guidance due to the small team and lack of B2B experience. This initiative comes directly from the CEO, adding to the pressure.

I have two weeks to present a strategy and need to start an action plan ASAP. I'm hoping to get advice and tips from anyone who's made the transition from B2C to B2B or has experience in this area. Specifically, I'm looking for insights on:
 * Effectively targeting C-level executives in the B2B space.
 * Building a robust lead generation funnel for high-ticket services.
 * Integrating ABM, content marketing, SEO, and paid advertising into a cohesive strategy.
 * Leveraging LinkedIn for lead generation and targeted outreach.
 * Resources to quickly learn more about b2b demand gen to present the strategy and learn as I go
Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated. I'm ready to learn and implement, but I need a starting point. Thanks in advance!

1jah00j,ABM - Best ways to support the sales team?,"I've been running an account based marketing program for the past year and a half, and I use that term loosely because it's really just a list of 300 companies that have been separated out to be targeted on LinkedIn. While it may not seem like much of a plan, I've been able to refine this list and get some high quality leads from some very promising companies. The challenge? They're all mostly ""1 and done"" type leads. They engage with a piece of content, and never engage with us again. What are some tactics you've used to get their attention and nurture them to the mid/bottom of the funnel? Some details on what I'm doing:

* Every lead that comes in gets put into a marketing nurture email workflow, which is mainly ""You might also be interested in this type of content."" There is a lead scoring system in place to measure engagement.
* The sellers have stopped reaching out to any of these leads because they've received very little, if any, response from them. I'm not so much surprised about this, since I don't think they're really looking at their lead score or personalizing the content to what might be of interest. And let's be honest, how many of us actually respond to a sales email? They would be interested in putting in the effort, but it has to be worth their time.
* Our sales cycle is usually pretty long, probably about 4 to 6 months. We target mostly fintechs, and we've separated out that ABM list into tier 1 (enterprise) and tier 2 (small/mid-sized). We see most engagement with the mid-sized companies.

We are a lean team. I am the only demand generation person who does both strategy and execution. We no longer have a content person or designer, so resources are limited. I don't have a large budget to buy all these fancy intent data programs. I know that true ABM is highly personalized, which we're doing none of right now. Is there a way to effectively do this but also making it easy for the sales team to utilize while minimizing the effort on my end? (Like I can't be creating personalized landing pages for every lead that comes through, but it would be nice if there was some type of program that the sales team could use to better personalize their outreach.) Is there a better way for marketing to nurture these leads before handing them off to sales?

1j7qroi,Which psychological trigger do you use most in your marketing?,"**Ever wonder why some ads get clicks while others get ignored?** It’s not just design... it’s psychology. The best marketers don’t just sell; they trigger emotions and decision-making instincts.

Here are **5 psychological triggers** that make people take action (and how you can use them in your marketing):

📌 **Key Takeaways:**  
✔ **Scarcity:** Ever noticed how “Only 3 left in stock!” makes you rush to buy? That’s FOMO in action. Scarcity creates urgency. Use it wisely in limited-time offers and stock alerts.

✔ **Curiosity:** Headlines like “You won’t believe what happened next” make people **stop scrolling**. The secret? Open loops that make the brain crave closure. Use this in ad copy &amp; emails.

✔ **Social Proof:** Would you rather try a product with 5,000 reviews or 5? People follow the crowd. Use testimonials, case studies, and UGC (user-generated content) to build trust.

✔ **Reciprocity:** Ever wondered why brands give away free trials? When people receive something valuable for free, they feel inclined to return the favor, whether by purchasing or engaging.

✔ **Authority:** Why do we trust a dentist’s toothpaste recommendation over a random ad? People trust experts.

1j3sdhd,MQL conversion funnels - should they include lower intent leads like webinar sign ups?,"I've seen so many opinions on this and every post is slightly different so I'm hoping to post our situation for some actionable advice. 

Context: My career was in sales mostly, I pivoted to product marketing, and now (at my startup) I've taken on a temporary growth marketing hat. Because of this, I want to help shape some of our reporting but I'm not 100% familiar with how it's typically done. 

That said, it doesn't look like my company has any conversion funnels set up outside of Hubspot. We use Salesforce (but lots of our dashboards are made in Sigma). I'm currently working with our RevOps team to mirror Hubspot and Salesforce MQLs (we don't need to get into this but they had a different scoring model until this week). Our MQLs in Salesforce seem closer to what our north start should be, they are form fills for inbound leads (from our contact us page) as well as form fills for our webinar sign ups (our next largest lead generator). We also get leads from paid social campaigns and content downloads but this number is much smaller and the intent is much lower. 

So I'm wondering how best to parse this out in something like a Salesforce report. My gut instinct is to have a funnel report of:   
\- all MQLs (inbound write-ins, webinar signs ups, leads from paid social campaigns)

\- SQLs (we don't have SALs because the volume is so low, the sales reps reach out to everyone) 

\- Opportunity

\- Closed

  
But what I'm wondering is if we shouldn't include webinar/social leads in the MQL bucket? I feel like it's diluting the top of funnel number. Alternatively I was thinking we could have it this way and then just look at conversion via campaign reports? 

Does anyone have any tips on how to set this type of reporting up?

1j3ctdj,The Fake MMS Marketing Funnel That’s Exploiting Women in India,"
For years, videos claiming to be “leaked MMS” of innocent women have circulated online. 

Most people ignore them. Some believe them. 

Few realize that they are part of a sophisticated marketing scam that exploits curiosity, social engineering, and digital loopholes to make money.


Who are the victims?

Some of the women falsely linked to these fake leaks include:

- Subashree Sahu
- Payal Shah
- Zara Dar
- Ritika Kharel
- Sapna Shah

These women did not record any explicit videos, yet their names and faces have been dragged into one of the most dangerous and unethical marketing scams in India today.

Today, I am breaking this funnel down in detail so people can understand how it works, why it’s effective, and how it can be stopped.


Step 1: Identifying &amp; Targeting Victims


The scammers search Instagram and YouTube Shorts for women who have:

- Public accounts

- Visible faces and bodies (makeup videos, dance videos, casual fashion content)

- Engagement (likes, comments, shares)

These women may have posted nothing explicit, but their videos are clipped, edited, and repurposed to make it seem like an actual MMS exists. 

99% of these “leaked MMS” are completely fake.


But the damage is immediate. Once the rumor starts, the woman’s name starts circulating in Telegram groups, search engines, and social media. 

People begin speculating, gossiping, and harassing the victim, making it almost impossible to stop the spread.


Step 2: The Clickbait Trap on Instagram &amp; YouTube


These scams primarily operate on platforms where users spend the most time:

- Instagram Reels
- YouTube Shorts

Scammers create short videos with:

Sensational thumbnails (blurred images, fake “screenshots”)

Misleading captions (“Leaked video of [victim’s name]! Click the link!”)

Fake comments claiming that people have already watched the video.

The key psychological trigger being used here is curiosity—leveraging the power of ""NEW.""

🚨 The phrase ""Iska bhi MMS leak ho gaya"" creates a false sense of urgency that makes people click.

The scam is entirely dependent on this one emotion. The moment someone believes a new MMS is out, they rush to click without thinking.


At this stage, many people fall for it and click the link.



Step 3: Redirecting to Telegram


Since Instagram and YouTube do not allow adult content links, scammers redirect traffic to Telegram.

Users are told:

- “The full video is in our private Telegram group.”

- “Only members can access the leaked video.”

- “Join before it’s deleted.”

Once inside the Telegram group, thousands of fake comments make it appear as though the video is real.

Meanwhile, Telegram pays group admins once they reach 1,000+ members, so scammers profit just by growing the audience.


Step 4: The Fake App Download


Instead of actually seeing any MMS, users are asked to download a specific app to “access the video.”

TeraBox 1024GB is the most commonly used apps in this scam.

Why? Because these apps pay per download through affiliate programs.

People download the app, open it, and are forced to watch multiple advertisements before they can “watch” the video. When they finally press play, they find:

- A completely unrelated video (sometimes a random girl, sometimes nothing sexual at all)

- More pop-up ads asking them to download another app

At this stage, scammers have already made money from ads and app downloads—without providing any real content.


Step 5: How They Actually Profit


This isn’t about leaking MMS. The real business model is:

- Affiliate Commissions from App Downloads – Every install earns them a payout.

- Ad Revenue from Video Platforms – Multiple ad views per user means guaranteed money.

- Telegram Monetization – Telegram starts paying admins once a group reaches 1,000+ members.

- Paid Promotions – Some scammers charge a fee to add fake names to their clickbait campaigns and artificially boost engagement.

These operations are highly organized, with multiple Instagram accounts, Telegram groups, and bot-generated comments to drown out anyone exposing the scam.


Why This is So Dangerous


It destroys reputations. Even if the videos are fake, victims suffer real-world consequences.

Victims face harassment. Many receive rape threats, blackmail attempts, and emotional distress.

It normalizes misinformation. People blindly believe what they see, making it easier for scams like this to thrive.

It’s nearly impossible to stop. Once a name is linked to “leaked MMS,” it keeps spreading across search results, forums, and Telegram groups.


What Needs to Happen


Social media platforms must do better. 

- Instagram and YouTube need stronger detection systems to remove these accounts.

- Telegram should stop rewarding scammers. 

- The platform should have stricter policies on monetization.

- People must stop believing everything online. 
Before assuming a leaked video is real, question the source.

- Victims need legal support. India must implement stronger digital protection laws to prevent these scams.


This is not just a marketing funnel. It’s digital defamation. It’s ruining lives, and it needs to be stopped.

He noted this could be caused by misconfigurations, caching issues, or other technical factors not immediately visible. Mueller advised webmasters to review their site's HTTP headers, ensure no conflicting directives are set, and review the server-side settings to resolve this issue.

* **Google AI Overviews Include Dozens of Links: Will Users Click?**

Google is testing AI Overviews in search results that include dozens of citations—sometimes 30 or even 50 links. This approach has sparked debate among SEO experts, who wonder if users will actually click on so many links.

* **Google Expands AI Overviews Testing to Germany, Switzerland, and Italy**

Although Google rolled out AI Overviews (AIO) to over 100 countries last year, places like Germany, Switzerland, and Italy had been left out—until now. The SEO community in these regions is actively sharing screenshots and insights on social media.

A recent update to Google’s crawler led to spikes in crawling time for some sites—especially those on certain CDNs. While overall crawl rates have dropped, the process itself is taking longer. 

Google also quietly updated its IP ranges for crawling, which may be causing issues for CDNs that haven’t adjusted their allowed IPs for Googlebot. Experts suggest checking with CDN providers to confirm IP ranges are up to date.

Although it only shows random data from Google Business Profiles at the moment, many believe additional features may be introduced later, offering deeper insights into physical store details. The feature is still in its early stages, and it remains to be seen how it will evolve.

Chegg, a publicly traded education technology company, has filed a lawsuit against Google, claiming that AI Overviews have significantly hurt its traffic and revenue. The company argues that Google's AI Overviews are using Chegg’s content to keep users on Google’s platform, blocking traffic from reaching Chegg. 

The lawsuit accuses Google of unfair competition and maintaining a monopoly in search, which negatively impacts Chegg’s business. While Google has defended the AI Overviews, stating that it helps users discover diverse content, Chegg believes that this practice is damaging the digital publishing industry and impeding access to quality educational resources.

* **Microsoft Tests Copilot Search with AI-Generated Summaries**

Microsoft is testing a new AI-powered search feature, potentially named Copilot Search. This feature, once part of Bing Chat, now provides users with AI-generated summaries pulled from multiple online sources. Users can try the new feature by going to a specific URL and replacing the query with any search term.

1j2md3z,Went viral on tiktok promoting other people's app - currently making me $3k/month,"So I basically became an affiliate of this company that pays 40% for people to promote their health focused mobile apps. I think this is way above industry standards lol?

Anyway they are not very strict with content guidelines but obviously you can't create content about p!rn or other sketchy stuff. The process is pretty simple. You sign up, they review your profile (I believe they manually generate an affiliate link and QR code for you), and then you pick one of their apps to promote by creating interesting content for it.

What I did was to post across IG reels and Tiktoks and hit a few bangers that drove traffic to their apps. Only thing that sucks is that payouts are 15 days after the month ends so it can take some time to receive the money but hell of a side hustle for me right now

1j1ulhi,That's what i did. How can I improve my website and increase conversions?,"I’ve built my website using **WordPress** with a modern template and fast hosting. I’m using **LiteSpeed Cache**, so my pages load almost instantly. I’ve put a lot of effort into making the site perform well and drive traffic, but I want to improve conversion rates—how can I get more potential clients to contact me after reading my articles?

Here’s what I’ve already done:

✅ **Performance &amp; UX:**

* Fast hosting and **LiteSpeed Cache** for instant page loads
* Modern, clean, and mobile-friendly design

✅ **Lead Generation &amp; Contact Options:**

* **WhatsApp chat button** for instant messaging
* **Contact form** in the sidebar of every article
* Published an **ebook**, advertised in the sidebar of each article
* The ebook ends with a **contact form**

✅ **SEO &amp; Traffic Growth:**

* **SEO optimization** (Yoast + manual improvements)
* **Link building** to improve authority (not a lot because it's super expensive but i'll continue with time)
* **IndexMeNow** for faster indexing (same with Google tools but just implemented, so i'm not sure it works yet)
* **Google My Business** for local clients (already more than 100 reviews with 5 stars).
* **Trustpilot** with around 30 reviews. Average 4.7 stars.
* **Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools** for stats and sitemap
* **Google Ads** for traffic

We would only be using the tool for analysis of other companies so anything that has to do with content creation is unnecessary.

An important note: we really just need a tool that is able to tell us basic information about a companies social media presence like engagement, activity, etc. Something easily digestible for sales people, advanced analytics are unnecessary.

1j06kvi,"AIO Buzz: AI Overview with 40, 50, 60+ links, AIOs have become a key part of Samsung's ad campaign, AI Overview rankings fluctuate more than Google’s organic search, beyond","Happy Friday, everyone! AI is evolving at an incredible pace, and we can’t imagine a more fascinating topic to follow right now. Some see it as a major concern (let us know if you feel the same), while others welcome the ways it simplifies their lives.

So, we’ve gathered the latest AI news and are ready to share it with you:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

***AI Overviews continue to push the boundaries of information retrieval with AI-driven results.*** The SEO community is actively sharing screenshots and videos of AI-generated snippets that reference dozens of web sources. And we’re not just talking about 20 links—SEO specialists are seeing cases where AI Overviews generate link clusters with 40+ sources.

The most notable discussions right now come from Lily Ray and Glenn Gabe. They were among the first in the SEO community to highlight this new iteration of AI Overviews, bringing it into the spotlight. Their posts quickly caught the attention of Barry Schwartz, who shared his take via Search Engine Roundtable:

*""I mean, if the AI Overview had maybe 3 to 5 links, sure, maybe a searcher will accidentally click on one of those links. But an AI Overview with 40, 50, 60 plus links. That is way too overwhelming and no searcher will click on those.""*

The SEO and marketing community keeps pointing out how AI-generated elements affect organic performance—ironically, on the same pages that provide the content for these AI snippets. It’s interesting to see how different sides of the search game react to these updates, weighing the good and the bad of whatever the search giant rolls out next.

Google often puts its boldest innovations to the test by rolling them out directly and gathering user feedback. Optimization typically follows, meaning what we’re seeing now is likely an early-stage version. We’ll be sure to keep a close eye on future updates and cover them in our upcoming digests.

***AI Overviews have become a pretty big deal in the smartphone market.*** It’s interesting how shifting your perspective to a different audience can completely change the way you see this technology.

Samsung, which is actively promoting its latest smartphone lineup, has made AI Overviews a key part of its ad campaign. AI-generated answers help users quickly get more details about various on-screen elements without extra effort. One X user broke down how AI Overviews enhance the user experience on the new devices:

*""Absolutely amazed by how seamlessly Circle to Search works! No need to switch apps—just circle any image, video, text, or even a playing song with your finger or S Pen for instant info &amp; AI Overviews.""*

A solid insight for anyone looking to expand their audience through new engagement channels!

***A new analysis by Authoritas, an ecommerce SEO platform, reveals that Google AI Overview rankings are more unstable than traditional organic search rankings.*** Within two to three months, 70% of AI Overview results changed, highlighting their volatility.

**Key Findings:**

* AI Overview rankings fluctuate more than Google’s organic search, with volatility scores of 0.68 (8 weeks) and 0.73 (13 weeks) compared to 0.49 and 0.55 for organic rankings.
* Top 10 organic rankings don’t guarantee AI Overview placement—40% of AI Overview results feature pages that aren’t in Google’s top 10.
* Text snippets within AI Overviews evolve over time, even when some cited sources remain unchanged.

With AI Overviews becoming a permanent fixture in search, SEO strategies must adapt. Monitoring AI Overview rankings and understanding shifts in visibility will be crucial for businesses looking to maintain search presence.

The study analyzed 11,203 keywords across three points in time (August, October 2024, and January 2025).

There has been active discussion within the SEO community about an unconfirmed Google Local feature that appears to remove organic listings from search results when the same URL appears in the local pack. This change suggests that if a page ranks in the local pack, it will likely not appear in the traditional organic results.

While this upgrade has not been officially confirmed, experts are recommending that businesses change the URL in their Google Business Profile to another page on their website to avoid potential issues.

*  **Google: There Is No Persistent Shortcut to Speed Up Crawling**

John Mueller confirmed that there is no ""persistent shortcut"" to faster crawling. While it is possible to expedite crawling in certain situations, there is no way to ensure faster crawling all the time. 

Нe explained that Google's systems, like all search engines, prioritize high-quality, unique content, and a strong technical foundation that does not hinder the crawling speed. To speed up crawling, websites need consistent high-quality content, uniqueness, value addition, and a solid technical structure.

* **Google Explained Why No Special SEO is Needed for Pagination**

To boot, John Mueller explained that there’s no need for special SEO treatment when it comes to paginated content. Google’s approach is straightforward: if something is useful on a paginated page, then it’s useful; if not, it doesn’t matter. 

There’s no need for a search engine to crawl 100 pages of a paginated set and combine them into a single URL. John emphasizes that SEO often assumes the need for complex solutions when, in fact, being explicit with search engines about what’s needed is often the best approach.

Google Business Profiles support is currently experiencing significant delays, with a backlog of support requests, including issues related to suspended business reinstatements, video verification delays, and other technical support tickets. 

Their product experts confirmed the delays, advising users to be patient as they work through the backlog. If you are encountering long wait times for support, you're not alone, as many users are facing similar challenges.

* **Google Now Provides Clear Reasons for Business Profile Verification Failure**

Google has upgraded its verification failure notifications for Google Business Profiles, now providing detailed reasons when verification fails. When a verification video doesn't meet all necessary requirements, the email notification will specify what exactly was missing, such as showing the business location, nearby landmarks, and the business name on permanent fixtures like signage. 

* **AI-Enhanced Images Now Available for Google Business Profile Posts**

A new feature has been introduced for Google Business Profiles, which allows businesses to enhance their posts with AI-generated backgrounds. The feature enables users to transform images by adding engaging, AI-powered backgrounds, improving the visual appeal of the photos they use in their posts as a result. 

To use this feature, business owners simply need to upload a photo and select a theme for the background. The AI then processes the image and creates a more dynamic result.

Google Merchant Center has started offering AI-generated summaries for performance insights, marking an experimental feature in the platform. These summaries offer merchants a quick overview of their performance, including metrics like increased traffic and clicks, along with personalized suggestions for improvement, such as optimizing product titles. 

This feature, although in the testing phase, is being used by many merchants who have received AI-powered recommendations over the last few months. The quality and accuracy of these AI-generated summaries may vary as Google continues to refine the feature.

* **AI-Generated Review Summaries Now Featured on Store Pages**

AI-generated review summaries are now being displayed on some top-quality store pages. When users click on a retailer or merchant's top-quality store link, they may see an AI-generated summary at the top of the reviews labeled as ""AI-generated from the reviews below and content on the web."" This update aims to make it easier for users to get an overview of reviews without having to read through thousands of them.

***Kevin Indig has released his research findings titled ""The Impact of AI Overviews on SEO:*** Analysis of 19 Studies."" This comprehensive work addresses several critical SEO questions:

* How frequently does Google display AI Overviews?

* What prompts the appearance of AI Overviews?

* What effect do AI Overviews have on click-through rates and SEO traffic?

* What strategies can help your content rank within AI Overviews?

* How should content creation be adapted in response to AI Overviews?

While you can delve into the full study via the provided link, the author emphasizes the following key points:

*1/ The number of keywords showing AI Overviews is going down. This could be related to tracking long-tail queries as people search longer questions when engaging with AIOs, and traditional SEO rank tracking is heavy on the short-head.*

*2/ The CTR impact of AIOs is negative. However, a lot of affected keywords already had low CTRs before the AIO came in.*

*3/ Citations in AIOs are drafted from the top 10 search results more often today compared to when they initially launched. However, brands that are not doing well in organic search still have a good chance of being visible in AIOs.*

1it1gfe,Is it worthwhile for me to try to create my own digital marketing agency?,"I (23F) am interested in starting a digital marketing agency that specializes in Social Media Management &amp; Strategy Development.  

I graduated in Dec 2023 with a Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration with a specialization in Marketing.  Since graduation, I have struggled to find a job due to my lack of experience and have considered going back to school to get my masters degree to help me find something. 

I currently manage 3 social media accounts:
- A clothing boutique (small business)
- 2 restaurants/nightclubs

My responsibilities for the boutique include:

- Content creation.  I film and photograph all of the content for social media and create graphics in Canva.
- Social media strategy.  I employ various marketing strategies that align with the brand goals (grow brand awareness and get people to come in the store).  This includes planning various promotions and sales, running social media advertisements, adhering to a content calendar, planning and promoting special events, partnering with other local businesses for giveaways/specials, partnering with influencers etc.
- Analysis.  I conduct A/B testing on social media ads through adjusting content types and target audience.
- Managing all social media accounts (Engaging with followers, responding to DMs, etc.)
- Creating a Shopify website.  I’m currently leading the project of setting up e-commerce through Shopify.

I’m essentially responsible for every aspect of marketing for this business which has provided me with a lot of valuable experience, especially because I had 0 experience going into it.  I’ve been successful in growing the business’s social media presence and my social media marketing skills have directly correlated to a growth in sales.

My responsibilities for the 2 restaurants/nightclubs include:

- Creating a content schedule for each location and posting in sync with upcoming events and such.
- Creating marketing strategies that align with each location (Both restaurants are owned by the same company but have different atmospheres/business goals so they require different marketing strategies).
- I am NOT responsible for creating the content, but rather coordinating with their graphic designer and photographers to curate content.
- Managing both social media accounts.
- Generating leads for table reservations.
- Coordinating with influencers and other local businesses.
- Running social media ads, tracking performance, and analyzing metrics.
- Creating giveaways and other promotions.
- Working with management and owners to align marketing strategies with business goals.

I just started this job today but I will be getting paid $400 a week for each restaurant ($800 a week).

Since I have been given this second opportunity, it has inspired me to potentially start my own social media marketing agency.  Technically I’m just doing freelance work at the moment, but I feel like I could make this grow into something substantial and eventually run my own company.

My plan would be to grow my local network by reaching out to local small businesses that either A) have 0 social media presence or B) have a weak social media presence that could use improvement and offer to take over their social media marketing efforts.  I feel I can showcase the work that I have done at these other businesses to establish my credibility and earn their trust.  Initially I would start by offering social media marketing services but eventually it could grow to where I could offer other aspects of digital marketing.

Based on the above information, how difficult would it be for me to start a social media marketing agency?  Is it worthwhile for me to try to pursue this full time or am I better off keeping this as a side gig?  What advice do you have for me?  Any advice/input/personal experience is appreciated!  Thank you!


TLDR:  I have a Bachelor’s in Marketing, I currently run 3 social media accounts &amp; develop social media marketing strategies for local businesses and I’m wondering if it would be possible to eventually scale this create my own social media marketing agency.",issalottasteeze,marketing,1739956889.0,1,1,0,https://reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1it1gfe/is_it_worthwhile_for_me_to_try_to_create_my_own/,https://reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1it1gfe/is_it_worthwhile_for_me_to_try_to_create_my_own/,False,,True,2025-11-26T05:24:19.167673+00:00
1isbpgo,"SEO News: Google Search Boosts Speed by 60ms with New Pre-Fetching Method, Reddit Blames Google Algorithm Update for Missed User Growth Targets, New Loyalty Pricing Features for Members in Merchant Listings","Hey guys! This week’s SEO news isn’t just for SEOs—it’s packed with insights for all marketers. A lot has happened in the digital world over the past week… Let’s break it down:

**Updates**

No official algorithm updates yet.

**Search / SEO**

* **Google Search Boosts Speed by 60ms with New Pre-Fetching Method**

We can now observe improvements in search speed through new pre-fetching methods. This approach, which uses the Speculation Rules API, reduced the Largest Contentful Paint for the first two results by 67 milliseconds on Chrome for Android. The desktop version saw similar gains, with a 58.6 millisecond reduction in LCP.

Additionally, for results beyond the first two, the First Contentful Paint was reduced by 7.6 milliseconds and LCP by 9.5 milliseconds. 

These enhancements aim to deliver a faster, more efficient user experience when navigating Google search results—particularly for mobile users.

* **Google Image Search May Be Downranking AI-Generated Images**

There is growing speculation in the SEO community that Google Image Search may be downranking AI-generated images in favor of non-AI images. Reports from various sources, including charts shared by Zack Notes, indicate a significant drop in image traffic in late January 2025, particularly for AI-generated content.

Some experts believe Google has introduced a quality metric that influences how AI-generated images are ranked compared to other images. While some users have confirmed similar declines in rankings, others suggest that multiple Google Image updates could be related to AI-generated content. Despite these observations, not all websites—even those featuring AI-generated hero images—have experienced the same drop in rankings.

**SERP features / Interface**

* **(test) Google Tests New 'Page Includes' Snippet in Search Results**

Google is testing a new snippet in its search results called “page includes.” This feature automatically pulls additional information from webpages and includes it in the snippet for certain search queries. 

For example, users searching for “laptops” might see unrelated data such as stock prices, which has raised concerns about the accuracy and relevance of the information displayed. Some users have expressed dissatisfaction with the feature, noting that it can present inaccurate details that may confuse or mislead them.

* **(test) New Filters for Latest Posts Carousel on Google**

The new feature, which adds filters to the ""Latest Posts"" carousel, allows users to sort posts by specific platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, X, and Facebook. This update aims to enhance the content discovery experience by providing an easy way for users to find posts from their preferred platform.

**AI**

* **(test)** **Google Introduces AI-Organized Local Events for a Better Search Experience**

Users can now test a system that uses AI to organize local events in search results. This new feature groups events such as concerts, theater performances, art exhibitions, and even restaurant specials, making it easier for users to find what they need. 

Events are categorized into groups like ""Events Today"" and ""Valentine's Day Events,"" including options for singles, couples, or romantic activities. Google's AI dynamically organizes these results, offering a more personalized experience for those searching for local activities. While still in testing, this feature promises to improve how users discover and engage with local event listings.

* **Google Merchant Center Introduces AI-Generated Summaries for Performance Insights**

Google Merchant Center has started displaying AI-generated summaries for merchants, providing insights into their performance in Google Search. These summaries, labeled as ""experimental"" and ""AI-generated,"" offer recommendations for improving product performance. For example, the summary might suggest focusing on optimizing product titles to better match search queries. 

Although the feature is still in its testing phase, many merchants have been receiving AI-powered suggestions over the past few months, including tips on optimizing sale pricing. Google has noted that the quality and accuracy of these suggestions may vary.

**Documentation**

* **Updated Merchant Listing with New Loyalty Pricing Features for Members**

Google has updated its Merchant Listing structured data documentation to support new membership loyalty pricing properties, currently in beta. This update enables merchants to specify member prices with new attributes, particularly the validForMemberTier property.

Note that this property can only be used with member prices and must not be combined with other price types, such as active or strikethrough prices. Overall, the update simplifies the implementation of complex pricing structures for merchants—especially for loyalty program members—allowing for more accurate product pricing representation on Google platforms.

**Local SEO**

* **Google Fixes Review Count Bug After Widespread Discrepancies in Local Listings**

Recently, the SEO community encountered a problem with review counts in Google. Many business owners noticed that their review counts were decreasing, even though there were no changes to their review profiles.

After numerous reports, Google confirmed that there was indeed a bug affecting the display of review counts. They clarified that the issue was related to the way reviews were being counted and displayed in search results.

While some businesses have already begun seeing their review counts return to normal, Google assured everyone that full recovery will take place soon.

**Tidbits**

* **Reddit Blames Google Algorithm Update for Missed User Growth Targets**

Reddit recently reported weaker-than-expected user growth, attributing the decline in its search-related traffic to a Google algorithm change. Despite a 39% year-over-year increase in daily active users, Reddit fell short of analysts’ expectations, reporting 101.7 million DAUs instead of the anticipated 103.1 million. 

CEO Steve Huffman explained that the algorithm update triggered volatility in search referrals but assured investors that traffic began to recover in the following quarter. However, Reddit's stock still dropped by 15%, highlighting the impact of Google's search changes on the platform's user metrics.

* **Full Transition to Auto-Generated Pages in Google News Publisher Center**

In March 2025, writers are expecting significant changes in the Google Publisher Center. Google has announced a full transition to automatically generated publication pages for the News section. After this transition, publishers will no longer be able to manually create or customize their publication pages, including logos, titles, or sections. 

Instead, Google News will use site favicons for publisher logos and site names for publication titles. These changes also mean that previously created custom sections in the Publisher Center will no longer appear. While Google aims to simplify the process, many publishers have expressed dissatisfaction with the loss of control over how their content is presented.

1ipi6fs,"Im about to hire my first marketing person, what are some realistic expectations for this position?","I run a small IT services company (15 employees, 3 of them in sales) and have a clear need for a dedicated marketing person.  Marketing is not my area of expertise so I would appreciate any input on what some realistic expectations are for the position.  Some of the tasks that I envision include:

* Posting content to social media and our website ""blog"" (we have access to content through a service, but it has to be branded)
* Branding - I have several ideas around doing this but need creative execution
* Generating original online marketing content, most likely in the form of simple, short videos and 1-4 panel comic strips (same as the branding, I have several ideas on what the content should look like).
* Standardizing the ""look"" of our forms
* Creating marketing materials such as flyers for our products and services
* Organizing and MCing quarterly events
* Updating website content and SEO (we have external contractors to help with the nuts &amp; bolts)
* Helping create and execute creative marketing campaigns for current and future prospects.  As an example, another company in our industry sent 50 good prospects a custom puzzle with 1 piece missing, and they could only get the missing piece by agreeing to an in-person meeting.

1iohbbq,DeepSeek: Cost-effective AI for SEOs or overhyped ChatGPT competitor?,"Guys, overhyped or not, when a little-known Chinese AI model suddenly dethrones ChatGPT in the Apple Store charts, it’s time to start paying attention. A quick Google search on DeepSeek reveals a rabbit hole of divided opinions. Some celebrate it for its cost-effectiveness, while others warn of legal and privacy concerns. But all seem to agree on one thing: DeepSeek can do almost anything ChatGPT can do.

For all digital marketers, DeepSeek is worth a closer look. But don’t ignore the security and privacy alarm bells ringing around the globe. It’s not pretty.

So what exactly is DeepSeek, and why should you care?

***5 Key Takeaways***

* DeepSeek’s R1 model challenges the notion that AI must cost a fortune in training data to be powerful.
* Cheap API access to GPT-o1-level capabilities means SEO agencies can integrate affordable AI tools into their workflows without compromising quality. Its online version and app also have no usage limits, unlike GPT-o1’s pricing tiers.
* Most SEOs say GPT-o1 is better for writing text and making content whereas R1 excels at fast, data-heavy work.
* A cloud security firm caught a major data leak by DeepSeek, causing the world to question its compliance with global data protection standards.
* DeepSeek’s censorship due to Chinese origins limits its conte

# Training &amp; Cost Efficiency

One of the biggest differences between DeepSeek R1 and ChatGPT is their training structure. DeepSeek R1 was trained using a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, activating only part of its 236B parameters at a time, making it highly cost-efficient. 

In contrast, ChatGPT-4 (likely using a combination of MoE and dense models) operates on a much larger budget, which allows it to handle a wider variety of tasks with higher accuracy but at a greater computational cost.

# Performance &amp; Capabilities

**Coding &amp; Logic:** DeepSeek R1 outperforms ChatGPT-3.5 in code-related tasks and logical problem-solving. However, GPT-4 remains the best AI for complex reasoning and multi-step problem-solving.

**Creativity &amp; Content Generation:** When it comes to writing long-form content, creative writing, and nuanced responses, ChatGPT-4 leads the way, producing more coherent and natural-sounding text. DeepSeek R1, though competent, falls short in generating human-like responses with depth and style.

**Mathematical &amp; Technical Queries**: DeepSeek performs well in math-heavy and technical fields, but ChatGPT-4 still dominates in general knowledge and balanced responses.

# Security &amp; Censorship Issues

One of DeepSeek R1’s biggest challenges is content censorship. Being China-based, it actively avoids politically sensitive topics and may redirect conversations on controversial subjects. Additionally, a recent security breach exposed its backend data, raising concerns about user privacy.

ChatGPT, on the other hand, adheres to OpenAI’s content moderation policies, but it is often criticized for over-censoring some topics. While it provides a safer and more predictable user experience, some users find it too restrictive in certain discussions.

# So, which AI model is better for you?

It's simple. If you need a cost-effective, coding-heavy AI with strong logic and math capabilities, DeepSeek R1 is a promising option. But if you prioritize content creation, nuanced discussions, and well-rounded responses, ChatGPT-4 remains the best choice.

**Search / SEO**

* **AI Overviews Introduces Detailed Comparison Mode for Product Searches**

Making decisions has never been easier. Google’s new AI Overview feature introduces a detailed comparison mode for product searches. For example, if you search for ""iPhone 15 vs iPhone 15 Pro,"" Google provides a side-by-side breakdown directly within the AI Overview, showcasing specifications and other essential details for both products.

This functionality empowers users to evaluate large amounts of product data without leaving the search page. While these overviews engage users effectively, their click-through rate remains low. On average, AI Overview results account for just 4% of clicks, compared to higher engagement levels seen with traditional snippets.

* **AI Overviews Are Hurting Click-Through Rates**

A study conducted by Seer found that AI Overviews significantly reduce CTRs for both organic and paid search results. Analyzing 10,000 keywords with informational intent, the study revealed a sharp decline in CTRs when AI Overviews appeared in search results.

Although Google claims AI Overviews drive more user engagement and clicks, the data tells a different story. Glenn Gabe’s analysis showed that AI Overview results captured only about 4% of clicks—a figure considerably lower than the CTRs typically seen for traditional search results or featured snippets.

**SERP features / Interface**

* **(test) New 'AI Mode' in Search for Open-Ended Queries**

Google is testing a new ""AI Mode"" in search, designed to address open-ended and exploratory queries that traditional search results struggle to handle. Powered by Gemini 2.0, this feature introduces a chatbot-like interface, allowing users to ask detailed or follow-up questions. Answers are presented in a clear, user-friendly breakdown.

Currently, Google employees in the US are piloting the AI Mode, with its official launch anticipated later in 2025.

* **(test) 'Share List' Button for Local Search Results**

You can now test the new ""Share List"" button for local search results on Google Search. This feature, available in local packs and business pages, allows users to easily share discovered locations with others, such as friends or colleagues.

It can be especially useful for collaboratively researching local businesses or places. Early feedback from users, shared through screenshots, suggests that this addition simplifies the process of sharing local information.

* **AI-Organized Local Events for a More Curated Search Experience**

Google is now leveraging AI to organize local events in search results. This new feature categorizes events into groups like today's happenings, concerts, theater shows, art exhibitions, museum hours, restaurants with daily specials, and indoor attractions. By doing so, users can easily discover relevant events without sorting through unrelated content.

The AI also curates events for specific occasions, such as Valentine's Day, offering tailored suggestions like romantic activities or events for singles and couples. While this feature is still being rolled out, it aims to enhance the user experience by providing more curated and accessible search results.

**Documentation**

* **Google Search Quality Rater Guidelines Now Address Generative AI and Its Impact on Content Quality**

The updated Search Quality Rater Guidelines reference ""generative AI"" for the first time, with 14 mentions throughout the document. While Google acknowledges the potential of generative AI in content creation, it also highlights risks associated with misuse, such as creating large volumes of low-value or unoriginal content.

The guidelines emphasize that content generated by AI should deliver originality and user value. If it fails to meet these criteria, it will be rated as ""Lowest."" Paraphrased AI content isn’t automatically classified as low quality, but it risks receiving the lowest rating if it lacks effort or creativity.

* **Google Warns Recipe Blogs: Excessive Scrolling Can Lead to Low Quality Ratings**

Google’s updated Quality Rater Guidelines warn against the negative impact of excessive scrolling on recipe blogs. The guidelines highlight that pages requiring significant scrolling to access main content—such as recipes—or making it difficult to locate the “jump to recipe” link are considered low-quality.

Google also notes that filler content, like unrelated photos, reviews, and ads, can harm the user experience. This update is particularly relevant for recipe sites, as poorly organized, cluttered pages risk receiving lower rankings in search results.

* **New Google Documentation: Integrating Google Analytics with Search Console for Enhanced SEO Insights**

You can now access an updated guide on integrating Google Analytics with Google Search Console to monitor and troubleshoot search performance. This comprehensive guide offers clear, step-by-step instructions for linking the two tools, helping webmasters and SEO specialists gain a deeper understanding of their site's search metrics.

By combining data from Google Analytics and Search Console, you can track how search traffic interacts with your website, resolve page performance issues, and optimize your SEO strategies with greater precision.

* **Product Studio AI Enhances Product Image Editing in Business Profiles**

The new Product Studio AI for Google Business Profiles enables businesses to enhance their product images using generative AI tools. This feature allows users to create more engaging visuals by modifying the background of product photos, resulting in a more appealing presentation.

Merchants can upload product images, remove existing backgrounds, and apply a generated theme to elevate their product listings. Currently, this scene-generation feature is available exclusively to merchants in the US.

* **Police Raid on SEO Experts Over Legitimate Google Maps Updates: 48-Hour Detention Sparks Outrage**

Last week, a concerning incident shook the digital community. Special units of the National Guard raided the office of an IT company based on a baseless complaint from an unethical competitor. The issue stemmed from standard SEO practices—recommendations made by two SEO experts to improve the accuracy of business information on Google Maps. Despite the legitimacy of these practices, the professionals were detained for 48 hours without valid justification.

This incident raises serious concerns about the authorities' understanding of digital practices and the rights of professionals to operate freely in the digital space.

1ii5jt3,For Creative Strategists &amp; DTC Brands Considering UGC Factory,"I’m sharing this because it’s important for both potential employees and brands to understand what they’re getting into. On platforms like TrustPilot and Glassdoor, negative reviews seem to get buried under an influx of five-star reviews, so I want to provide some transparency.

# For Creative Strategists / Creative Directors:

If you’re considering working here, be aware that the **pay structure has recently changed**—shifting from **$35 an hour to a flat $350 per client** (depending on the base pay tier you’re placed in). This effectively **caps you at 10 hours per client**, regardless of how much work is actually required. Some workers have found that **even if assigned seven clients, they may only be compensated for all seven, only the five based on their pay tier.**

The company also **offers a $350 retention bonus for every client you keep past three months**, but it appears to be paid out only after each full three-month period. While this is positioned as an incentive for quality, it may also create additional pressure.

# Work Expectations Include:

* Writing **24 unique ad scripts per month**.
* Managing **communications with creators, editors, and clients**.
* Reviewing creator footage and **overseeing edits from overseas editors** that often require extra direction.
* Using an **AI script generator** that produces copy many clients find **repetitive or unnatural**.
* **Providing input to refine AI-generated scripts**, which some believe is being used to build intellectual property for future monetization.

Many workers feel this **pay structure does not fairly reflect the workload**. Additionally, some have raised concerns that their **strategic contributions** may be used to develop AI-driven tools that could **further reduce the need for human input over time**.

Beyond workload and pay, there is a **culture of fear**—many workers feel uncomfortable asking questions or pushing back on **tight deadlines and high expectations** out of concern for **negative feedback from leadership.** The company does **not offer structured skill development or mentorship**, though recently, they began providing “free” access to a new course. While this is framed as a benefit, some employees feel it does not replace **fair compensation or career growth opportunities**.

# For DTC Brands Considering UGC Factory:

With this new pay structure, it’s worth **asking questions** before partnering with the company. Creative Directors are **limited to 10 hours per client**, meaning their time and creative energy must be divided across multiple brands under strict constraints.

Some clients have raised **concerns about the quality and authenticity of content**, particularly with UGC creators. If you prioritize **high-quality, original creative strategy**, it may be worth **clarifying how much time is dedicated to your brand and how content is developed.**

Transparency is key, and I hope this helps those considering a role here or a partnership with the company.

1ies37w,Marketing work for an author in exchange for revenue share,"I have a published author who wants a website and marketing for his author business. Website will be its own separate fee and then he wants to do a rev share on the book sales and speaking engagements in exchange for marketing. Below are some of the rough details. Have any of you done a trade like this with an author before and how did you/would you split it? If you did a tiered rev share, how would you structure that? For reference, he has been self-publishing books and doing speaking engagements for a couple of decades without much revenue. He is a great writer and speaker (has been a professor for decades) but has done absolutely no marketing so his sales are very minimal. I have 13 years of experience in marketing, but never structured a contract quite like this one for an author before. Thank you for your insights!

1idufu9,Lead Generation for Design Studio,"Hey everyone!

I'm co-owner of a design studio that provides brand identity services.
Staring price is USD4800 and average project price is USD6000ish.

Up until now we are acquiring leads by creating Instagram content, and doing some commercial campaigns there.
Because of this, the number of leads we receive really depends to how much we can dedicate ourselves to content production and to commercial campaigns (we still have a lot of fulfilling to do), and makes lead generation inconsistent.

I was thinking about how to have a consistent flow of leads coming in, and came with two options:

1. Content Distribution Funnel
Producing our content in a way that we have different depths of consciousness, with the last layer making a pitch for a call.
Running those through ads in a way that we take the colder audience, take through all layers of content ending with the pitch.

2. Creating a Direct Sales funnel
Creating a direct sales funnel, Russel Brunson style, starting with a lead magnet (ebook or webinar probably), and pitching for the upsell that would be our brand identity service.

Both options would allow us to run this consistently and regardless of content creation (after initial set of advertising creatives is generated at least).

I would like to hear opinions from ppl that already implemented either, both, or at least is familiar with either.

The SEO is also generating about 10 leads a month and has slowly ramped up over the past two years since I’ve been doing SEO.  So currently in total I spend $3,000 for 20 leads or $150 per lead.

I’ve got about $50,000 earmarked for marketing spend to spend over four months as I launch my new expansion. That $50K includes both “one time” investment (consultants, strategy, website work, etc) and recurring monthly costs during this implementation phase. This marketing spend will be invested over a period of four months. By the end of the four months, I’d like to be at a steady state with double the amount of leads from previously, ie about 40 leads per month. I’m willing to double the cost I’ll allow for a lead up to $300 per lead.  

More context, I have a valuable email list of about 1,000 emails of past leads or contacts that filled out information forms. I tried a couple email blasts but got a very poor open rate and gave up. Peer to peer therapist marketing is not a bad strategy (the other therapist might have a client they can refer), but I haven’t tried much. I have over 10 hours of content that I could have someone pick apart to push a reels/tiktok/youtube shorts campaign. I could also build a good youtube channel. I tried facebook marketing, but it wasn’t profitable. I built my website myself. It’s decent but not great. Part of my budget was going to be allocated to a website polish and strategist to help me with the pitch, landing page, product offering, etc. Of everything I’ve tried, Google ads is most dependable but the more I spend, the less efficient it gets. I’m not sure how much more I can go. 

How would you spend the $50,000 budget? I’m thinking about 2/3 of that will be in “investment/experimentation” and 1/3 of that will be in recurring monthly ppc/seo.  I’m a DIY guy but I don’t know if I have the time or expertise to optimize this process. Should I plan it myself or should I find a great consultant with experience in niche therapy/coaching/course content marketing and turn the strategy over?

1ict622,I do more roles than I’m paid for - advice welcome 🙏,"I work for a small business in London. I have been there for 2,5 years and was employed part-time as the social media manager. Since then I have taken on more roles and responsibilities. I have volunteered for some of them as I wanted to gain the experience.

1. Social media manager. I organise, schedule and copywrite across various profiles (Instagram/facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest)
2. Content creator. I arrange photoshoots for new content with photographers and also do the styling sometimes. I also get my own content (photo and video) and edit it. 
3. I built the new website (in wix) and am responsible for the upkeep and updates on there. 
4. Lead generation. I reach out the potential new clients via email and on Instagram. I will be doing a gen more of this from now on. I have generated income for the business this way and am not on commission.
5. Various admin and business development. I have done research on new business opportunities but due to various reasons outside my control this has been put on hold. 

I quite like being involved but I am starting to feel like I’m spreading a little thin on my part time hours and part time salary. I’m looking to go more freelance on the side but mentally my PAYE job takes up a lot of space and although it’s consistent it doesn’t pay the greatest. It’s very flexible, which is a must for me and it allows me to rely on a set amount of income every month. I get paid for the hours I work and I send this across myself. 

What hourly rate or pro rata do you think it sounds like I should be on? 

I also think my boss is great and it’s the first job I feel very comfortable and accepted in!

Thanks you to anyone who takes the time to give feedback :) I don’t really know anyone in a similar job or industry to me so am operating on my own. Any input is very welcome 🙏 ",Somethinsomethinnice,marketing,1738155511.0,1,1,4,https://reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1ict622/i_do_more_roles_than_im_paid_for_advice_welcome/,https://reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1ict622/i_do_more_roles_than_im_paid_for_advice_welcome/,False,,True,2025-11-26T05:24:19.167673+00:00
